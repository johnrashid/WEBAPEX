          <p><em>By Mark Twain</em></p>
          <p>At half-past nine that night. Tom and Sid were went to bed as usual. They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and waited in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still and stared up into the dark. Everything was dismally still. By-and-by, out of the stillness little, scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad. A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Poly's chamber. And now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate began. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the bed's head made Tom shudder- it meant that somebody's days were numbered. Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last he was satisfied that time has ceased and eternity begun; he began to doze in spite of himself, the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear it, and then there came, mingling with his half formed dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighbouring window disturbed him. A cry of 'Scat! You devil!' and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt's wood-shed brought him wide awake and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the 'ell' on all fours. He 'meow'd' with caution once or twice as he went; then jump to the roof of the wood-shed and thence to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.</p>

          <p>Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hillside. To entertain himself, he sang out, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!"</p>
          <p>When the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive the wolf away. But, when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when seeing their angry faces.</p>
          <p>"Don't scream wolf, boy," warned the villagers, "when there is no wolf!" They angrily went back down the hill.</p>
          <p>Later, the shepherd boy cried out once again, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!" To his amusement, he looked on as the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away.</p>
          <p>As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly, "Save your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don't cry 'wolf' when there is no wolf!" But the boy grinned at their words while they walked grumbling down the hill once more.</p>

          <p><em>Story By: Judie Eberhardt</em></p>
          <p>Carson was going back to school after Spring Break. He had heard that a new boy would be starting at his school. Carson was anxious to meet him and make a new friend. That day at lunch, the new boy came and sat across from Carson. Carson said hi and asked him his name. The boy answered, "None of your business." Carson was surprised that the boy would be so mean. Carson ate his lunch in silence.</p>
          <p>School let out, and on the walk home the new boy came up behind Carson and said, "Let me have your homework so I can copy it." "I know you finished it at school." "I'm not giving you my homework," said Carson. "That would be cheating." As Carson started to walk away, the boy tripped Carson. Carson fell, ripped his pants, and got a big scrape on his knee. The boy started laughing and ran away. Carson got up and headed home. "What happened?" asked mom when Carson came into the kitchen. The new boy at school tripped me because I wouldn't let him copy my homework," said Carson. "Who is this new boy?" mom asked. "His name is Jack, and I only know that because I heard the teacher call him that." "He was mean to me at lunch when I asked him his name," said Carson.</p>
          <p>The next day Carson's mom went to the school and told the principal what had happened. Jack was called to the office and admitted he tripped Carson. "Why?" asked Mrs. Rogers the principal. Carson was only trying to be nice to you in the cafeteria yesterday when he asked you your name." "This is the third school I've been in since school started," said Jack. "I guess I was trying to be a tough guy so no one would mess with me." "Well, did it ever cross your mind that if you would just be yourself and be kind, the kids would be your friend?" asked Mrs. Rogers. Jack said he was very sorry. Mrs. Rogers said that Jack needed to talk to Carson and tell him he was sorry. Jack did apologize to Carson and his mom. Carson's mom invited Jack to the house for dinner. Carson told his mom that Jack is really nice but just had a hard time fitting in. "I'm glad you have a new friend," said Carson's mom.</p>

          <p>Ellie's mother had to travel for work.</p>

          <p>Ellie didn't want her mother to go either. Then she had an idea.</p>
          <p>She went up to her room, sat at her desk, and wrote out six notes, one for each day her mother would be gone. While her mother was packing, she slipped the notes into the suitcase.</p>
          <p>When her mother got to her hotel and opened her suitcase, she found the pile of notes. The envelopes were labeled: open day one, open day two, etc. Ellie's mother opened the envelope labeled day one. It said:</p>
          <p>You're the best Mom in the world. Thank you for working so hard. If I were there, I would give you the biggest hug in the world.</p>
          <p>Opening her notes each day was the best part of the trip for Ellie's mom. When she got home, she told Ellie, "I have the best kid in the world. Thank you for writing those notes!"</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">The Three Brothers</h2>
          <p>Once upon a time there were three brothers living all alone in a faraway land. Their names were: Strong-Arm, Wise-Head and Good- Heart. Strong-Arm spent all his time very happily running, jumping, throwing spears and swimming in the river. Wise-Head too was very happy. He spent all his time reading, writing, learning, and making things with his hands. Good-Heart was the happiest of all. He spent all his time helping his brothers and cooking their food.</p>
          <p>But as they grew older, the three brothers began to wonder whether they were really completely happy. So one day the Queen of the Good Spirits decided to teach them something. She changed herself into a little girl, and sat on the top branch of a great silk-cotton tree that no-one could ever climb, calling "Help" "Help!"</p>
          <p>Good-Heart was always ready to help anyone in trouble and he looked up and saw the little girl. But how could he get her down? He didn't know. So he asked his brothers for help. Wise-Head thought about the problem. He worked out the height of the tree, made a long piece of thin string, and tied a stone to one end of it. Then he told Strong-Arm to throw the stone over the highest branch. When the stone fell to the ground again, the string was right over the branch. Then Wise-Head tied a long thick rope to the string, and pulled the other end of the string until the rope too went right over the branch and down again. But Wise-Head couldn't climb the rope himself. He had to get Strong-Arm's help again. So Strong-Arm climbed up the rope, and brought the little girl safely to the ground. The three brothers all felt wonderfully happy because that they had saved the little girl. They laughed, and danced and sang. And just at that moment, the little girl became the Queen of the Good Spirits once again, and this is what she said: 'Now you have learnt that being only strong or only wise or only good is not the best thing. The best thing is to be strong and wise and good.</p>
          <p>So the three brothers lived happily all their life, doing things together, anr goodness with wisdom and strength. And their names became mixed up. they became known by everyone as Wise-Arm, Good-Head, and Strong.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Checkouts</h2>
          <p><em>By: Cynthia Rylant</em></p>
          <p>Her parents had moved her to Cincinnati, to a large house with beveled glad windows ano several porches and the history her mother liked to emphasize. You'll be lonely at first, they admitted, but you're so nice you'll make friends fast. And as an impulse tore at her to lie on the floor, to hold to their ankles and tell them she felt she was dying, to offer anything, anything at all, so they might allow her to finish growing up in the town of her childhood, they firmed their mouths and spoke from their chests, and they said, It's decided.</p>

          <p>They moved her to Cincinnati, where for a month she spent the greater part of every day in a room full of beveled glass windows, sifting through photographs of the life she'd lived and left behind. But it is difficult work, suffering, and in its own way a kind of art, and finally she didn't have the energy for it anymore, so she emerged from the beautiful house and fell in love with a bag boy at the supermarket. Of course, this didn't happen all at once, just like that, but in the sequence of things that's exactly the way it happened.</p>

          <p>She liked to grocery shop. She loved it in the way some people have to drive long country roads, because doing it she could think and relax and wander. Her parents wrote up the list and handed it to her, and off she went without complaint to perform what they regarded as a great sacrifice of her time and a sign that she was indeed a very nice girl. She had never told them how much she loved grocery shopping, only that she was "willing" to do it. She had an intuition which told her that her parents were not safe for sharing such strong, important facts about herself Let them think they knew her.</p>

          <p>Once inside the supermarket, her hands firmly around the handle of the cart, she would lapse into a kind of reverie and wheel toward the produce. Like a Tibetan monk in solitary meditation, she calmed to a point of deep, deep happiness; this feeling came to her, reliably, if strangely, only in the supermarket.</p>

          <p>Then one day the bag boy dropped her jar of mayonnaise, and that is how she fell in love.</p>

          <p>He was nervous-first day on the job-and along had come this fascinating girl, standing in the checkout line with the unfocused stare one often sees in young children, her face turned enough away that he might take several full looks at her as he packed sturdy bags full of food and the goods of modern life. She interested him because her hair was red and thick, and in it she had placed a huge orange bow, nearly the size of a small hat. That was enough to distract him, and when finally it was her groceries he was packing, she looked at him and smiled, and he could respond only by busting her jar of mayonnaise on the floor, shards of glass and oozing cream decorating the area around his feet.</p>

          <p>She loved him at exactly that moment, and if he'd known this, perhaps he wouldn't have fallen into the brown depression he fell into, which lasted the rest of his shift. He believed he must have looked a fool in her eyes, and he envied the sureness of everyone around him: the cocky cashier at the register, the grim and harried their breaks. He wanted a second chance. Another chance to be confident and say witty things to her as he threw tin cans into her bags, persuading her to allow him to help her to her car so he might learn just a little about her, check out the floor of the car for signs of hobbies or fetishes: and the bumpers for clues as to beliefs and loyalties.</p>

          <p>But he busted her jar of mayonnaise, and nothing else worked out for the rest of the day. Strange, how attractive clumsiness can be. She left the supermarket with stars in her eyes, for she had loved the way his long, nervous fingers moved from the conveyor belt to the bags, how deftly (until the mayonnaise) they had picked up her items and placed them into her bags. She had loved the way the hair kept falling into his eyes as he leaned over to grab a box or a tin. And the tattered brown shoes he wore with no socks. And the left side of his collar turned in rather than out.</p>

          <p>The bag boy seemed a wonderful contrast to the perfectly beautiful house she had been forced to accept as her home, to the history she hated, to the loneliness she had become used to, and she couldn't wait to come back for more of his awkwardness and dishevelment.</p>

          <p>Incredibly, it was another four weeks before they saw each other again. As fate would have it, her visits to the supermarket never coincided with his schedule to bag. Each time she went to the store, her eyes scanned the checkouts at once, her heart in her mouth. And each hour he worked, the bag boy kept one eye on the door, watching for the red-haired girl with the big orange bow</p>

          <p>Yet in their disappointment these weeks, there was a kind of ecstasy. It is reason enough to be alive, the hope you may see again some face which has meant something to you. The anticipation of meeting the bag boy eased the girl's painful transition into her new and jarring life in Cincinnati. It provided for her an anchor amid all that was impersonal and unfamiliar, and she spent less time on thoughts of what she had left behind as she concentrated on what might lie ahead. And for the boy, the long often tedious hours at the supermarket, which provided no challenge other than that of showing up the following workday. these hours became possibilities of mystery and romance for him as he watched the electric doors for the girl in the orange bow.</p>

          <p>And when finally they did meet up again, neither offered a clue to the other that he, or she, had been the object of obsessive thought for weeks. She spotted him as soon as she came into the store, but she kept her eyes strictly in front of her as she pulled out a cart and wheeled it toward the produce. And he, too, knew the instant she came through the door-though the orange bow was gone, replaced by a small but bright yellow flower instead and he never once turned his head in her direction but watched her from the corner of his vision as he tried to swallow back the fear in his throat.</p>

          <p>It is odd how we sometimes deny ourselves the very pleasure we have longed for and which is finally within our reach. For some perverse reason she would not have been able to articulate, the girl did not bring her cart up to the bag boy's checkout when her shopping was done. And the bag boy let her leave the store, pretending no notice of her.</p>

          <p>This is often the way of children, when they truly want a thing, to pretend that they don't. And then they grow angry when no one tries harder to give them this thing they so casually rejected, and they soon find themselves in a rage simply because they cannot say yes when they mean yes. Humans are very complicated. (And perhaps cats, who have been known to react in the same way, though the resulting rage can only be guessed at.)</p>

          <p>The girl hated herself for not checking out at the boy's line, and the boy hated himself for not catching her eye and saying hello, and they most sincerely hated each other without having every exchanged even two minutes of conversation.</p>

          <p>Eventually-in fact, within the week a kind and intelligent boy who lived very near her beautiful house asked the girl to a movie, and she gave up her fancy for the bag boy at the supermarket. And the bag boy himself grew so bored with his job that he made a desperate search for something better and ended up in a bookstore where scores of fascinating girls lingered like honeybees about a hive. Some months later the bag boy and the girl with the orange bow again crossed paths, standing in line with their dates at a movie theater, and, glancing toward the other, each smiled slightly, then looked away, as strangers on public buses often do when one is moving off the bus and the other is moving on.</p>

          <p><em>By Louisa M. Alcott</em></p>
          <p>"CHRISTMAS Won't be Christmas without any presents," grumbled Jo, lying on the rug. "It's so dreadful to be poor!" sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress. "I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things, and other girls nothing at all," added little Amy. "We've got father and mother and each other," said Beth from her corner. The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly. "We haven't got father, and shall not have him for a long time."</p>

          <p>Thinking of father far away, where the fighting was. Nobody spoke for a minute: then Meg said, "You know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for every one; when our men are suffering so in the army. We can make our little sacrifices. But I am afraid I don't;" and Meg shook her head. "I agree not to expect anything from mother or you, but I do want to buy Undine and Sintram for myself; I've wanted it so long," said Jo, who was a bookworm. "I planned to spend mine in new music," said Beth, with a little sigh. "I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing-pencils; I really need them," said Amy decidedly. "Mother didn't say anything about our money and she won't wish us to give up everything.</p>

          <p>Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun." cried Jo. "I know I do, teaching those tiresome children nearly all day," began Meg. "You don't have half such a hard time as I do," said Jo. "How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps you trotting till you're ready to fly out of the window or cry?" "It's naughty to fret; but I do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world and my hands get so stiff." and Beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that anyone could hear that time. "I don't believe any of you suffer as I do," cried Amy; "for you don't have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses." "Don't you wish we had the money papa lost when we were little, Jo?" said Meg, who could remember better times.</p>

          <p>Malala Yousafai was born in Mingora, Pakistan on July 12, 1997. Her father, a teacher who ran a school for girls in their village, was committed to Malala's education. Malala loved school, but when the Taliban seized their village, they forbid the people there to do many things they had formerly enjoyed. Television and music were banned, and girls were no longer permitted to attend school. Anyone who disobeyed these edits was punished harshly.</p>

          <p>Malala spoke out publicly about how girls had the right to an education, she became a target of the Taliban. One day in October 2012, when she was on the bus on her way home from school, a man wearing a mask got on the bus and asked, "Who is Malala?" He then shot her in the head.</p>

          <p>Malala woke up after ten days in the hospital. During that time, her story had spread around the world and people everywhere were praying for her to get well. She underwent several surgeries and months of rehabilitation before she was able to return home to her family, now living in the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>Malala has chosen to make the most of her situation as a public figure, and today she continues to fight for girls to have the right to an education. Working with her father, she established the Malala Fund, which helps girls achieve their dreams. For this work, Malala was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2014, making her the youngest-ever Nobel laureate. She graduated from Oxford University, and today spends her time traveling and supporting educators and activists on behalf of girls struggling to go to school.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Rice Bowl Wishes</h2>
          <p>Once in a village in China, three young boys, each eleven years old, were adopted by an old lady, Nii Yoo, from an orphanage. She sent two of them, Lan Dua and Swa Jow, to school and dressed them in very fine clothes. However, the third little boy, Gow Sir, was blind, and she treated him as a servant. She dressed him in very old ragged clothes and fed him the food left-over by the other boys. Gow Sir wasn't sent to school and ran errands for Nii Yoo.</p>

          <p>One night, when a deadly fire broke out in the room where they stored rice. Lan Dua and Swa Jow ran out of the house to escape the fire. Gow Sir risked his life, went inside to help Lady Nii Yoo escape the fire. He carried her on his back and both were saved.</p>

          <p>Knowing how brave and selfless Gow Sir was, the old lady gave him a rice bowl that could grant wishes, before her last breath. She told him that the rice bowl could grant one wish a year, two wishes every two years, and three wishes every three years. Also, she added, all the wishes would be revoked if the rice bowl was broken. So she told him to wish wisely.</p>

          <p>When Gow Sir wished for his vision to see lady Nii Yoo one last time before burying her, the bowl granted him the same. Lan Dua and Swa Jow soon came back and got to know about the rice bowl. The two boys wished for a house, food, and good grades in school without studying. After three years, it was time again to make wishes. While the two boys wished for houses and gold, Gow Sir wished for a library loaded with books.</p>

          <p>Every three years, Lan Dua and Swa Jow continued to wish for mansions, gold, wives, sons, and high-rank offices in the village, without working for any of it. Whereas, Gow Sir, wished for more books to replace his old ones and went on reading them. He gathered a lot of knowledge over the nine years.</p>

          <p>After nine years, on one such occasion, when the three of them came together to make wishes from the rice bowl, both Lan Dua and Swa Jow wanted to keep the bowl to themselves. They tried to grab the bowl and dropped it meanwhile. Immediately. Gow Sir lost his vision, and the other two lost all their possessions.</p>

          <p>Lan Dua and Swa Jow learned the lesson of their stupidity and became the oldest pupils at the school. They became very dedicated to their studies. However, Gow Sir did not lose the knowledge that he gained from the books, and he was known to be among the wisest teachers in China. Even though the rice bowl lost its magic, Gow Sir glued its broken pieces and kept it on his desk as an ordinary bowl.</p>

At half-past nine that night. Tom and Sid were went to bed as usual. They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and waited in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still and stared up into the dark. Everything was dismally still. By-and-by, out of the stillness little, scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad. A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Poly's chamber. And now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate began. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the bed's head made Tom shudder- it meant that somebody's days were numbered. Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last he was satisfied that time has ceased and eternity begun; he began to doze in spite of himself, the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear it, and then there came, mingling with his half formed dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighbouring window disturbed him. A cry of 'Scat! You devil!' and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt's wood-shed brought him wide awake and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the 'ell' on all fours. He 'meow'd' with caution once or twice as he went; then jump to the roof of the wood-shed and thence to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.

          <p><em>By Hans Christian Andersen</em></p>
          <p>There were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers, who were all brothers, for they had been made out of the same old tin spoon. They shouldered arms and looked straight before them, and wore a splendid uniform, red and blue. The first thing they ever heard was the words, "Tin soldiers!" uttered by a little boy, when the lid of the box was taken off. They were given him for a birthday present, and he stood at the table to set them up. The soldiers were all exactly alike, excepting one, who had only one leg; he had been left to the last, but they made him to stand firmly on one leg, and this caused him to be very remarkable. When the children came in the next morning, they placed the tin soldier in the window. But the window flew open, and out fell the tin soldier, it was a terrible fall. It began to rain, till there was a heavy shower. When it was over, two boys happened to pass by, and one of them said, "Look, there is a tin soldier." So they made a boat out of a newspaper, and placed the tin soldier in it, and sent him sailing down.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">The Eighth Tail Story</h2>
          <p><em>By: Andrew Frinkle</em></p>
          <p>I was near to completing myself. I had gained seven of my nine tails, and soon I would be far more than the fox I had been born as. Of course, even as a young fox kit, I had been more than just a fox. I was a Gumiho, a forest fox spirit destined to gain 9 tails by learning important lessons.</p>

          <p>Each lesson so far had made me more and more human. I'd learned to look like them, speak like them, and to an extent even think like them. Of course, my disguises were not perfect, and it had taken me years of practice to get to where I was. I'd made a few friends along the way, but these last few lessons had taken me a great deal of time to figure out, and the children I had known in the human villages the forest were now grown up. Most had children and families of their own, so I spent my days walking the forest, coming upon humans when I could, often hunters and fishermen, so I could practice being human.</p>

          <p>Today marked a special event in the villages, a summer festival. Everyone would wear special robes and dresses, and many lanterns would be lit. Prayers would be said, and bells would ring at midnight. It was one of the biggest festivals of the year, and I'd been preparing myself for it. I'd even assembled a summer dress of my own from scraps and pieces of cloth that I'd pilfered from townsfolk.</p>

          <p>My dress was white, with patches of red I'd cut to look like cherry blossoms. I had a matching red belt tied around my waist, and I had flowers in my hair as well. I'd even managed to make my own sandals for the outfit. Girls of the town also used makeup to color their faces, which I found odd, but I felt it would better hide my true nature, so I tried it as well. Of course, I did not have the powders and paints they had for their faces, so I had to make do with berries to stain my lips and flowers to color my cheeks and eyelids. I had to say that when I looked into my own reflection on a sliver of a mirror I had found and kept, I did not recognize myself.</p>

          <p>I made my way into town as the sun began to set. People from surrounding farms and smaller communities were riding horses, carriages, and wagons to come visit the larger town. One kind old man and his elderly wife even offered me a ride, seeing how I was walking alone along the road. We made conversation as we went, and I was very careful about what I said. My communication skills were rusty from disuse, but I think I managed to convince them that I was a young woman who lived in the next valley, and that I was meeting some cousins in town.</p>

          <p>In town, I climbed down from the wagon and offered my thanks with a deep bow, a gesture I'd learned from watching humans. They smiled and wished me luck in finding my cousins, and waved as I melted into the crowds.</p>

          <p>People in a rainbow of robes and dresses lined the streets. The streets were mostly packed dirt, but the sidewalks were cobbled with large flat stones. Along these cobbled walks, vendors had set up to sell treats and sweets. Others had set up silly games of chance, where one might win a hair ribbon or even a goldfish. Children ran about, tearing up and down the streets with a freeness that I envied. I had not felt that type of freedom since I was a young fox kit running in the woods.</p>

          <p><em>By L. M. Montgomery</em></p>
          <p>"I've thought of something amusing for the winter," I said as we drew into a half-circle around the glorious wood-fire in Uncle Alec's kitchen. We had been having a game of Blind-Man's Buff. It had been splendid at first, but later the fun went out of it. But as we dropped into our places the Story Girl shot a glance at me that this was the moment for introducing the scheme she and I had been developing for some days. It was really the Story Girl's idea. "Let us get up a newspaper of our own-write it all ourselves, and have all we do in it." Everyone looked rather blank and amazed, except the Story Girl. She knew what she had to do, and she did it.</p>

          <p>"What a silly idea!" she exclaimed "I think it's a splendid idea," Felicity said enthusiastically. "I think it would be a great fun," said Peter decidedly. The Story Girl could hide her delight. "Bev wants to be editor," she said, "I think it would be nice," said Cecily. "Will it be printed?" asked Dan. "Oh, no," I said. "We can't have it printed. We'll just have to write it out-we can buy foolscap from the teacher."</p>

          <p>"Well, it's decided, then, that we're to have a newspaper," I resumed. "The next thing is to choose a name for it. "I think it would be nice just to call it Our Magazine, Cecily said. "Our Magazine it will be, then," I said. "If I'm to be editor you'll all have to be sub-editors" "Oh, I couldn't," protested Cecily. "You must." "Well, we ought to have an etiquette department, then," said Felicity. "Of course we'll have one," I said, "and Dan will edit it." "We want you to edit the household department, Felicity," I said. Felix will edit the jokes and the Information Bureau, and Cecily must be fashion editor. The Story Girl will attend to the personals. They're very important. Bev will run the scrap book department, besides the editorials," said the Story Girl. "Aren't you going to have a story page?" asked Peter. "We will, if you'll be fiction and poetry editor," I said. "All right," he said, recklessly. "We can put anything we like in the scrap book department." I explained, "but all the other contributions must be original, except the personals. We must all do our best. Our Magazine is to be 'a feast of reason and flow of soul.' "Well, we'll go ahead then," I said, with a sigh of relief that the project had been so easily launched. "We'll get the first issue out about the first of January."</p>

          <p><em>By Aesop</em></p>
          <p>A Hare was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow.</p>

          <p>"Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.</p>

          <p>The Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the Fox, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance and started the runners off.</p>

          <p>The Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Hare, he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up.</p>

          <p>The Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the Hare was sleeping. But the Hare slept on very peacefully, and when at last he did wake up, the Tortoise was near the goal. The Hare now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time.</p>

          <p><em>By Dom Respighi Lincoln</em></p>
          <p>Volcanoes, be they continental (land-based) or submarine (underwater), are one of our planet's most fascinating natural wonders. Bursting from beneath the Earth's crust, they are a constant reminder of the tumultuous and superheated environment raging beneath our feet. Yet, for all those images of volcanoes roaring into life on land, exploding with white-hot magma and plumes of ash, these violent acts only account for a small percentage of our volcano population. The biggest and most numerous candidates are instead beneath our seas, lurking in shallow waters and deep ocean depths.</p>

          <p>These underwater vents and fissures account for a staggering 75% of our planet's annual magma output, with most of these volcanic wonders buried under an average of 2,600 miles of water. Around 5,000 known submarine volcanoes are currently in an active state, and these structures (which can range from 10m high to a staggering 3,500m from the seabed) play a vital if temperamental role in the fragile ecosystems of marine life. While many can provide the correct chemical conditions to support life, they can also wreck a previously established ecosystem causing population of fish and plankton to plummet as a result. They can also produce new lands, creating volcanic islands that quite literally rise from the depths. The islands of Hawaii, for instance, are the product of the submarine volcano eruption beneath the waves.</p>

          <p>Volcano Formation: All volcanoes are formed by the shifting of tectonic plates into the lithosphere (the outmost layer of the Earth's composition). These plates depend as continental or oceanic; depending on their location can be affected by a variety of elements, including the rotation of the planet, gravitational pull and even the positioning of the Moon and the Sun.</p>

          <p>Unlike their continental brethren, submarine volcanoes only exist along locations known as boundaries. These boundaries come in three distinct varieties-convergent, divergent and transform- but submarine volcanoes only occur on boundaries that host convergent and divergent activity.</p>

Dogs, undistinguishable in mire. Horses, scarcely better, splashed to the ir very blinkers. Foot passengers, jostling one another's umbrellas in a general infection of illtemper, and losing the ir foot-hold at street-comers, where tens of thousands of other foot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke (if this day everbroke), adding new deposits to the crust upon crust of mud, sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement, and accumulating at compound interest.</p>

          <p>Fog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls de filed among the tiers of shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city.

One crisp autumn afternoon, while walking through the outskirts of her town, she stumbled upon something remarkable. Hidden behind a tangle of vines and weathered stone was what appeared to be the entrance to an ancient building. The faded letters etched above the archway read. Eterna Bibliotheca.</p>

          <p>Curiosity overcame caution, and Amara pushed open the heavy wooden door, its hinges groaning in protest. Inside, the air smelled of dust and forgotten memories. Shelves towered over her, filled with books whose spines were cracked and faded. Light filtered through a shattered stained glass window, casting colorful patterns on the worn marble floor. It was breathtaking. She wondered why no one had mentioned this place before. Was it truly forgotten, or had it been deliberately left to time?</p>

          <p>As Amara wandered deeper, she noticed peculiar things. Some books glowed faintly. their pages warm to the touch. One book, resting on a pedestal at the center of the library. seemed to hum softly when she approached. The cover bore no title, only a strange symbol she didn't recognize. Against her better judgment, she opened it.</p>

          <p>The pages were blank at first, but then words began to appear, forming sentences as if an invisible hand were writing them. The words spoke directly to her, recounting her own memories, fears, and dreams in eerie detail Startled, she closed the book and stepped back. her pulse racing. Who had created this library, and why did it seem to know her?</p>

          <p>Amara's mind buzzed with questions, but one thing was certain: this library held se crets she was only beginning to uncover. As she left. the door creaked shut behind her, and she couldn't help but feel that the library had awakened after years of silence and it wasn't finished with her yet.</p>

          <p>The next day after school, Mom took Lisa to the library to get her a card. The lady at the desk asked Mom to fill out a paper and then asked Lisa to print her name. She then told Lisa how many books she could borrow on her card. Lisa was so excited! She could hardly wait to search the many shelves of books. Lisa's favorite books were mysteries. She liked to solve the mystery in her head and see if she was right when she got to the end of the story. Her other favorite books were ones that took her to faraway places.</p>

          <p>Lisa had three books to return the next day and was excited to take out three more. However, when Lisa got to the library, she didn't have her card. "Oh no!" Lisa said to the lady at the desk. "I can't find my library card!" "I'm sorry," said the lady. "I can't let you take any books without your card." Lisa left the library feeling very sad and also worried what her Mom would say when she told her she lost her card.</p>

          <p>When Lisa got home, Mom told Lisa that a boy came to the house with her library card, and he said he found it on the sidewalk near the library. "It must have dropped out of one of the books I was carrying," said Lisa. "You were lucky that boy found your card," said Mom. "You need to be very careful." "Having a library card is a big responsibility." Lisa said, "I think I will keep it in my wallet." Mom said, "Let's go back to the library and get those books you wanted." "Sounds great," said Lisa. When they got to the library, Mom decided to get some books too. While they were in the library, Mom told Lisa the boy that found her card was sitting at the round table. Lisa went over to him and said, "Thank you for finding my card." He told Lisa he was glad to help, and they both looked for some mystery books together. Lisa had her books, her card, and a new friend too!</p>

The swans suggested an idea according to which the tortoise would have to hold a piece of the stick by its mouth and the swans will hold the ends of that stick.</p>

          <p>They warned the tortoise to not talk during their journey. The tortoise promised, and the three friends set out to fly. On their way, they crossed several villages. Many villagers saw the tortoise and made fun of the tortoise.</p>

          <p>"John," one of them asked, "what is the secret to a successful and fulfilling life?"</p>

          <p>John smiled and invited them to his farm. He showed them a small, withered seed and said, "Life is much like this seed. It holds the potential for growth, but it requires patience, effort, and the right conditions."</p>

          <p>He continued, "Plant this seed in fertile soil, water it diligently, and give it sunlight. Over time, it will grow into a strong and fruitful plant."</p>

          <p>The young villagers nodded in understanding. John then shared stories from his own life, illustrating the importance of hard work, honesty, and compassion. He spoke of times when he faced challenges but persevered, always staying true to his values.</p>

          <p>As the sun set, John concluded, "A successful life is not measured by wealth alone. It is about caring for relationships, learning from failures, and contributing positively to society."</p>

          <p>The young villagers left John's farm inspired and motivated. They realized that success wasn't an overnight achievement but a journey of continuous improvement and personal development.</p>

          <p>And so, they carried the wisdom of the wise old farmer with them, applying his teachings to their own lives. As the years passed, the once-withered seed of knowledge grew into a forest of strong character and thriving hearts.</p>

          <p>Over the past 70 to 80 years, the household lifestyles of middle class Americans have been getting increasingly more extravagant. In 1949, the average size of a single-family home was 909 square feet. By 2021, the average size of an American single family home had reached 2.480 square feet! Not only do some people find the size of these homes excessive; for many they are also unaffordable. For most people, purchasing a home in America today comes with a mountain of debt, a sinkhole of interest, and at least 30 years of working to pay for it all, often in a job that homeowner doesn't even really want to be doing. One form of resistance against this lifestyle which began in the 1970s has become known as the Tiny House Movement.</p>

          <p>A tiny house is a dwelling space that averages between 160 and 200 square feet. Tiny houses are small enough and light enough to be towed by a pickup truck, yet they still contain areas for cooking, living, and sleeping, as well as a bathroom. Today, singles, couples, and even families call tiny houses their home.</p>

          <p>They not only have the advantage of being portable. They are also significantly less expensive than a conventional single family home. Depending on how handy you are with construction and the availability of materials, a tiny house can be built for as little as $8,000, though they typically cost the new homeowner between $30,000 and $60.000. But even $60,000 is a fraction of what people are paying for single family real estate in many areas of the country.</p>

          <p>The decision to go tiny requires some radical self-evaluation, What do people really need to live comfortably? In many areas of the world. people still live for simpler lives than those lived by Americans, who are continually assaulted on television, radio, and social media with advertisements designed to make them think they need more and more personal belongings to be happy.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">What Causes Reflections?</h2>
          <p><em>Cross-Curricular Focus: Physical Science</em></p>
          <p>Light from the sun or a light bulb moves in straight waves. When the light waves hit an object, they bounce off of it. This action is called reflection. For most objects, the light bounces in many directions at the same time. When this happens, it allows us to see the object. A picture of the object is sent to the brain from the eye. The brain helps us understand what we see.</p>

          <p>Light waves also bounce when they hit a smooth, shiny surface. Hitting a surface like a mirror makes the light waves bounce directly back to your eyes. This movement allows you to see yourself. It creates a reflection. You see the objects around it instead of the mirror itself. Anything shiny may act like a mirror when the light hits it. Have you ever seen your face reflected in the rounded side of a pot or pan? You can even see reflections on the surface of water if it is smooth and still. You have probably seen beautiful pictures of mountain scenes. Often the mountains and sky are reflected on the smooth surface of the lake.</p>

          <p>Water and glass have a special ability. They can refract, or bend, light. That's why a spoon in a clear glass of water will look bent when it really is not. The ability of glass to refract light has given us some useful products. Eyeglasses help us see clearly. Magnifying glasses enlarge our view of an object.</p>

Eventually, cornered and on the verge of death, he finds a Swiss army knife and uses it to stab the creature, finally killing it. When he makes it home—bloody, traumatized—his parents reveal that he has been missing for an entire week, leaving him confused about what really happened.

          <p>Scott was so excited to be going on the summer day camp trip to the woods. His group was going to fish, float on a raft, and spend two nights sleeping in a fort—all the things boys his age love to do and no little sister to bother him. After arriving at camp, some of the boys wanted to go with Mr. Allen fishing, and some of the boys went on a raft with Mr. Willard. Scott said he was going fishing. "All of you that are going fishing stay with me," said Mr. Allen. Tony, Joey, Mike, and Scott were the ones that chose fishing. Larry, Eddie, and Jason wanted to go on the raft. They left with Mr. Willard.</p>

          <p>The boys gathered up their fishing poles and baskets to hold the fish they were sure they were going to catch. They started down the trail toward the lake. Lake Amber was about a half mile down the trail. The boys arrived at the lake quickly, however when they got there, Scott was not with them. "Where's Scott?" Mr. Allen asked the other boys. "He was right behind me," said Tony. "We did move ahead for a little while," said Joey. Mr. Allen became very worried and started shouting, "Scott, Scott!" No answer. Scott suddenly found himself lost on the trail leading to Lake Amber. "I only looked away for a minute," he thought to himself. "How could I be lost?" Scott decided to turn around and go back the way he came. He remembered the direction to the lake was south. He also remembered he had his compass from his last Boy Scout trip in his pocket. He took out his compass and realized he had been going north. Scott started down the trail in the opposite direction. As he did, he yelled, "Mr. Allen, Joey, Mike." Mike thought he heard someone yelling his name and tried to listen closely. Mr. Allen heard it too. Everyone stayed together and headed to where they heard the voice calling to them. All of a sudden, Scott jumped out from behind a tree and said, "I am so glad to see you guys!" "What happened?" asked the boys and Mr. Allen. "I was looking at the trees." "I must have made a wrong turn," said Scott. "When I realized what happened, you were gone." "Well, we're here now," said Mr. Allen. "Let's make sure we stay together." "Okay," the boys said and headed back to the lake to catch some fish.</p>

          <p>But the surprises didn't end there. As I touched down in a meadow, I spotted a friendly-looking cow grazing nearby. With a casual thought, I transformed her into a talking, poetry-loving cow named Clarabelle. We had a delightful conversation about the meaning of life and the best way to eat daisies.</p>

          <p>Next, I wandered into a nearby forest, where I encountered a mischievous squirrel who was busy organizing a protest against the shortage of acorns. I joined their ranks and became the official "Squirrel Ambassador" for the day, leading a march to the local nut shop to demand better nut distribution.</p>

          <p>By the time the sun began to set, I found myself back in my room, lying in bed once more. It was then that I realized the day's adventures had all been a dream, an extraordinary journey through the landscapes of my imagination.</p>

"Oh no," Rachel huffed, getting up to tend to the baby. Returning holding the baby, Rachel said, "I can't get her back to sleep. If I sit here with the kids would you go round and say something?" "Of course," he replied and stood up. He knocked on the neighbour's door and waited for an answer. He knocked again but it was a while before anybody came to the door.

The beaker shattered into a sticky, multicolored mess, leaving Professor Bumblebee covered in gooey jellybeans. His once-beloved invention had become his greatest misadventure.</p>

          <p>With a sigh of defeat, Professor Bumblebee realized the impracticality of his idea. He spent days cleaning up the laboratory, removing jellybeans from every nook and cranny. The world would have to wait a bit longer for unbreakable glass.</p>

          <p>Despite the chaos and stickiness, Professor Bumblebee's misadventures continued to bring laughter and wonder to the world of science. And who knows? Maybe one day, he would stumble upon a discovery even more remarkable than jellybean glass.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">The Reign of Robespierre</h2>
          <p>Following the events at the Bastille, the Third Estate's National Assembly again demanded that King Louis XVI address their concerns, but he was unable to do so. The Third Estate and their National Assembly then took over the country. A few years later, King Louis XVI was put on trial for treason by the revolutionaries, who formally ended the monarchy in France. Louis XVI was beheaded on January 21, 1793. The National Assembly changed its name several times. From 1793 to 1794, it was called the National Convention and led by a man named Maximilien Robespierre. This period was known as the Reign of Terror.</p>

          <p>Robespierre was a member of the Jacobins, a group of radical revolutionaries who had a great amount of power at the time. The first Jacobins were National Assembly members with common political ideas who held meetings in the Jacobin monastery in Paris. The group grew quickly once the revolution began. At the height of its power, it included half a million members located all over the country. The Jacobins were made up of two factions. The more moderate faction was called the Girondists. The radical faction was called the Montagnards (mountain group) and was led by Robespierre.</p>

          <p>In an attempt to restore order in a fractured country under siege from foreign enemies and civil war skirmishes, Robespierre took over the government of France on September 5, 1793. He declared that the "order of the day" would be terror. Thus began the most violent period of the French Revolution. During this time, it was a crime punishable by death to even be suspected of not supporting the revolution.</p>

          <p>Robespierre was eventually removed from office by the French people and executed. The Jacobin Club was disbanded and many of its leaders were imprisoned or put to death.</p>

          <p>The robbery was to be thoroughly planned and brilliantly executed. There were to be no mistakes. Everything must go according to plan. Everything must run smoothly. There must be no mess-ups. That's what was drilled into them day after day. They went through plan after plan, map after map, until they knew everything about everything. They knew each entry and exit point in detail and exactly what to do on the inside. There was no room for anything to go wrong. At least that's what they thought at the time. The robbery would take place at exactly 3am—late enough that there would be very few, if any, people wandering around, early enough that it would still be pitch black.</p>

          <p>"Having memorised the maps and the alarm codes, Rob pulled a balaclava down over his face. Him and Dave were to go in alone. They waited outside in the bushes, checking no one was around. Once it was clear the place was empty, they went up to the door of the bank. In this area the streetlamps were turned off at one in the morning, so it was deathly dark. Rob picked the lock and Dave got ready to turn off the alarm. If it was done within three seconds it would turn off without alerting the police. One. Two. Three.</p>

          <p>They did it. They were inside. Now all that had to be done was collecting the money and getting out. The safe was in the back room with a five-digit code. Dave shut the door behind them and they ran through to the back. Rob bent down to the safe and spun the dial for the code.</p>

          <p>One day, the prince and the servant were going to a neighbouring country. The prince rode a strong and sturdy horse while the servant followed him on a frail horse.</p>

          <p>They had to travel a long distance. After a few hours, the sky became overcast and loud thunder could be heard at a distance behind them. The prince was a coward and was very frightened by the clap of thunder. He looked around for a place to hide but found none. His servant had not caught up with him yet. So the prince made his strong horse walk slower and waited for the servant. When he saw the servant, he shouted, "Don't lag behind me, you fool! Keep up with me!"</p>

          <p>The servant replied, "How can I keep pace with you? My horse is so weak." On hearing this, the prince was furious and he roared, "It means you have not fed the horse well. It is all your fault. What were you doing all this time, lazy man?" Then he struck the servant on his head as hard as he could.</p>

          <p>At that very moment, there was a streak of lightning in the sky. The prince was so frightened that he closed his eyes tightly. The servant saw this and suddenly had a brilliant idea. He took advantage of the opportunity and swinging his riding whip, knocked the prince on his head. The prince thought that lightning had struck him. He was terrified.</p>

          <p>It was early spring and Toby and his little sister Kate were excitedly looking forward to their vacation break from school. Only two more days, thought Toby, and I will be able to have some fun in the sunny warm weather. It had been a long, cold winter and Toby wanted to be outside.</p>

          <p>Toby suddenly had an idea that he wanted to go camping over the weekend to celebrate the start of spring break. What better way to enjoy the outdoors than to go camping? Toby ran into the house to find his Dad and tell him his idea. Dad thought it was a great idea too. "If you kids want, we can go to Quiet Lake." Kate started jumping up and down with excitement because the last time she went to Quiet Lake she caught her first fish. "Maybe I'll catch another fish!" Kate said hopefully. "Well, you two better go out to the shed and start finding our supplies and don't forget the tent," said Dad. Kate and Toby went to the dusty shed out back and found the fishing poles, the tent, and the cooking supplies they would need. Now all they needed was for the next two days of school to pass by quickly.</p>

          <p>It was finally Friday and that night at dinner Dad said, "You kids need to get to bed early." Dad wanted to start for the lake around seven o'clock.

          <p>It is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes, we should be able to see distinctly that strange thing that each one individual of the human race corresponds to some one of the species of the animal creation; and we could easily recognize this truth, hardly perceived by the thinker, that from the oyster to the eagle, from the pig to the tiger, all animals exist in man, and that each one of them is in a man. Sometimes even several of them at a time. Animals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our vices, straying before our eyes, the visible phantoms of our souls. God shows them to us in order to induce us to reflect. Only since animals are mere shadows, God has not made them capable of education in the full sense of the word; what is the use? On the contrary, our souls being realities and having a goal which is appropriate to them, God has bestowed on them intelligence: that is to say, the possibility of education. Social education, when well done, can always draw from a soul, of whatever sort it may be, the utility which it contains.</p>

          <p>This, be it said, is of course from the restricted point of view of the terrestrial life which is apparent, and without prejudging the profound question of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which are not man.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Welcome To Oregon</h2>
          <p><em>Story By: Andrew Frinkle</em></p>
          <p>I live in Oregon. It is a Northwestern state, near Canada. Oregon is famous for the Pacific Ocean, forests, the Cascade Range, hazelnuts, lumber, and Crater Lake! It is the 9th largest state and the 27th most populous. You might know some of the major cities, like Portland, Eugene, Salem, and Gresham. The state capital is Salem. Now that you know some of the basic facts about Oregon, let me tell you a little more about my state.</p>

          <p>Oregon had several Pacific Northwest Indian tribes living there when the Spanish first visited the area that would become Oregon. The French and then the British held the land. In the 1840s, the Oregon Country was actually led by their own government, until it was annexed by the United States. The famous Oregon Trail for settlers led to the expansion of settlements in the area and eventual statehood.</p>

          <p>Oregon is located just beneath Washington, making it one of the northernmost states on the Pacific Ocean. It has a long coastline on the ocean, and inland you find many forests leading up into The Cascade Range. These are the three major environments in the state: coast, forest, and mountains. There are also rich farmlands.</p>

          <p>Oregon produces almost all of our nation's hazelnuts. Cattle, dairy, and cranberries are a few other agricultural products Oregon produces. Due to its location on the coast, of course fishing is a huge deal. With the forests, timber and lumber is a big industry. Oregon led the nation in softwood lumber production. With all this wood getting cut down, is it a surprise to know that Oregon is The Beaver State?</p>

          <p>Oregon isn't so well known for sports as many other states, but they do have a professional soccer and a professional basketball team based in Portland. With the natural beauty, Portland is a great place to get outside. You can fish, hike, climb mountains, and do all sorts of things outside.</p>

          <p>Oregon is interesting because it has no sales tax! Only 5 states have no sales tax. They also have very low state income taxes. Oregon is 41" in our nation for tax burdens, making it a good place to live if you don't want to pay much for taxes. They also have a tax revenue limit, so if too much money is collected in taxes, they have to give some back. What a place, right?</p>

          <p>Now that you know a little more about Oregon, are you thinking about visiting? There are many things to see and do. Hope to see you soon!</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">A Conversation From the Third Floor</h2>
          <p><em>By Mohamed El-Bisatie</em></p>
          <p>She came to the place for the second time. The policeman stared down at her from his horse.</p>
          <p>The time was afternoon. The yellow-coloured wall was stretched right along the road. Inside the wall was a large rectangular three-storey building; its small identical windows looked more like dark apertures. The woman stood a few paces away from the horse. The policeman looked behind him at the windows, then at the woman. He placed both hands on the pommel of the saddle and closed his-eyes. After a while the horse moved. It was standing halfway down the street. Then, a moment later, it made a half-turn and once again stood itself at the top of the street.</p>
          <p>The woman came two steps forward. The horse bent one of its forelegs, then gently lowered it.</p>
          <p>“Sergeant, please, just let me say two words to him.”</p>
          <p>His eyes remained closed, his hands motionless on the pommel. Above the wall stretched a fencing of barbed wire at the end of which was a wooden tower. Inside there stood an armed soldier.</p>
          <p>The woman took another step forward.</p>
          <p>“ You see, he’s been transferred ...”</p>
          <p>The sun had passed beyond the central point in the sky. Despite this the weather was still hot. A narrow patch of shade lay at the bottom of the wall.</p>
          <p>The woman transferred the child to her shoulder.</p>
          <p>When she again looked at the policeman’s face, she noticed two thin lines of sweat on his forehead.</p>
          <p>Quietly she moved away from in front of the horse and walked beside the wall. About halfway along it she sat down on a heap of stones opposite the building.</p>
          <p>The prisoners’ washing, hung by the arms and legs, could be seen.</p>
          <p>She took the child between her hands and lifted him above her head.</p>
          <p>She noticed his arms suddenly being withdrawn inside and his hands gripping the iron bars of the window. Then his face disappeared from view. For a while she searched for him among the faces that looked down. She lowered her arms a little and heard shouts of laughter from the window. She spotted his arm once again stretching outwards, then his face appeared clearly in the middle.</p>
          <p>“Up, Aziza. Up. Face him towards the sun so I can see him.” She lowered her arms for a moment, then raised him up again, turning his face towards the sun. The child closed his eyes and burst out crying.</p>
          <p>“He’s crying.”</p>
          <p>He turned round, laughing.</p>
          <p>“The boy’s crying! The little so-and-so! Aziza, woman, keep him crying!”</p>
          <p>He cupped his hand round his mouth and shouted, “Let him cry!”</p>
          <p>Again he laughed. A few shouts went up around him. She heard their words and shouting. Then she saw his large nose poking out through the bars,</p>
          <p>“Woman! Don’t be silly, that’s enough! Cover tile boy- he’ll get sunstroke!”</p>
          <p>She hugged the child to her chest and saw the soldier withdrawing inside the tower,</p>
          <p>“Did you prune the two date palms?”</p>
          <p>She shook her head.</p>
          <p>“Why not? Why don’t you talk? I’m being transferred. Pass by Abu Ismail and tell him I send him my best wishes. He’ll do it as a favour and prune the trees, then you can bring along a few dates. Did you bring the cigarettes?”</p>
          <p>She made a sign with her hand.</p>
          <p>“Talk. What are you saying?”</p>
          <p>“You’ve got ‘em,”</p>
          <p>“Louder, woman.”</p>
          <p>“You’ve got ‘em, I sent them to you.”</p>
          <p>“When?”</p>
          <p>“Just Now.”</p>
          <p>Her face was against the sun. She shifted her head-veil slightly from her head.</p>
          <p>“They took a couple of packets. Never mind, Aziza. Never mind.”</p>
          <p>He laughed. His voice had become calm. The other faces disappeared from above him, only a single face remaining alongside his.</p>
          <p>“Did you build the wall?”</p>
          <p>“Not yet.”</p>
          <p>“Why not?”</p>
          <p>“When Uncle Ahmed lights the furnace, I’ll get some bricks from him.”</p>
          <p>“All right. Be careful on the tram. Look after the boy.”</p>
          <p>She remained standing.</p>
          <p>“Anything you want?”</p>
          <p>“No.”</p>
          <p>She gazed at his face, his large nose, his bare arms. She smiled. The face next to him smiled back.</p>
          <p>Suddenly he shouted. “Did you get the letter? I’m being transferred.”</p>
          <p>“Where to?”</p>
          <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
          <p>“When?”</p>
          <p>“You see, they’re pulling down the prison.”</p>
          <p>“Where will you go?”</p>
          <p>“God knows-anywhere. No one knows.”</p>
          <p>“When?”</p>
          <p>“In two or three days. Don’t come here again. I’ll let you know when I’m transferred. Has the boy gone to sleep?”</p>
          <p>“No, he’s awake.”</p>
          <p>He stared back for a while in silence.</p>
          <p>“Aziza !”</p>
          <p>Again there was silence. The face alongside his smiled, then slowly slid back inside and disappeared. Her husband remained silent, his arms around the bars.</p>
          <p>Suddenly he glanced behind him and quickly drew in his arms. He signalled to her to move away, then disappeared from the window.</p>
          <p>She stepped back, though she remained standing looking up at the window.</p>

          <p>The narrator’s father, determined to graduate from college at the age of sixty-two, unexpectedly enrolls in an English class taught by his own child. The narrator, reflecting on their childhood, admits to grading his father more strictly than other students, giving him a hard, honest, low C—mirroring the tough approach the father had always shown toward him.</p>
          <p>During this period, the narrator and his mother leave town to attend a family funeral, while the father remains behind to finish his final exams. Upon returning home, they discover that the father’s grades were too low to allow him to graduate. The shock and disappointment overwhelm him as he reads the news on the sofa, and he suffers a fatal heart attack.</p>
          <p>Although the narrator initially believed that his father’s death would leave little emotional impact, he ultimately finds himself deeply affected. The story reflects on themes of parental expectations, the weight of legacy, and the unexpected ways life and death can shape personal emotions and relationships.</p>

          <p><em>By Leonard Q. Ross</em></p>
          <p>Ivan was a timid man mocked by the villagers with nicknames like “Pigeon” and “Ivan the Terrible.” Every night he passed by the village cemetery on his way home but never dared to cross it, even though it would save him time. The villagers, particularly a young Cossack lieutenant, often taunted him for his fear, daring him to walk through the cemetery in the bitter winter cold. One night, tempted by the lieutenant’s challenge and the promise of five gold rubles, Ivan reluctantly agreed to cross the cemetery and plant a saber in front of the largest tomb.</p>
          <p>As Ivan entered the cemetery, the wind howled and the cold pierced through his coat. Though he repeated to himself that the earth was “just earth,” his fear grew stronger as he ran toward the central tomb. Trembling and shivering, he finally drove the saber into the ground and pounded it to the hilt, completing the task. At first, it seemed he had succeeded in meeting the challenge, but as he tried to rise, something invisible gripped him.</p>
          <p>By morning, the villagers found Ivan lying in front of the tomb, dead from a nameless horror rather than the cold. The saber remained planted in the ground, evidence that he had completed the lieutenant’s challenge. Ivan’s tragic end highlighted the power of fear and the terror of the unknown, leaving the villagers to contemplate the mysterious forces that had claimed him.</p>

          <p><em>By Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.</em></p>
          <div style="white-space:pre-wrap;">
HARRISON BERGERON by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.

THE YEAR WAS 2081, and everybody was finally equal. They weren't only equal
before God and the law. They were equal every which way. Nobody was smarter
than anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody was
stronger or quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the
211th, 212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing
vigilance of agents of the United States Handicapper General.
Some things about living still weren't quite right, though. April for
instance, still drove people crazy by not being springtime. And it was in
that clammy month that the H-G men took George and Hazel Bergeron's fourteen-
year-old son, Harrison, away.
It was tragic, all right, but George and Hazel couldn't think about it very
hard. Hazel had a perfectly average intelligence, which meant she couldn't
think about anything except in short bursts. And George, while his
intelligence was way above normal, had a little mental handicap radio in his
ear. He was required by law to wear it at all times. It was tuned to a
government transmitter. Every twenty seconds or so, the transmitter would
send out some sharp noise to keep people like George from taking unfair
advantage of their brains.
George and Hazel were watching television. There were tears on Hazel's
cheeks, but she'd forgotten for the moment what they were about.
On the television screen were ballerinas.
A buzzer sounded in George's head. His thoughts fled in panic, like bandits
from a burglar alarm.
"That was a real pretty dance, that dance they just did," said Hazel.
"Huh" said George.
"That dance-it was nice," said Hazel.
"Yup," said George. He tried to think a little about the ballerinas. They
weren't really very good-no better than anybody else would have been, anyway.
They were burdened with sashweights and bags of birdshot, and their faces
were masked, so that no one, seeing a free and graceful gesture or a pretty
face, would feel like something the cat drug in. George was toying with the
vague notion that maybe dancers shouldn't be handicapped. But he didn't get
very far with it before another noise in his ear radio scattered his
thoughts.
George winced. So did two out of the eight ballerinas.
Hazel saw him wince. Having no mental handicap herself, she had to ask George
what the latest sound had been.
"Sounded like somebody hitting a milk bottle with a ball peen hammer," said
George.
"I'd think it would be real interesting, hearing all the different sounds,"
said Hazel a little envious. "All the things they think up.""Um," said George.
"Only, if I was Handicapper General, you know what I would do?" said Hazel.
Hazel, as a matter of fact, bore a strong resemblance to the Handicapper
General, a woman named Diana Moon Glampers. "If I was Diana Moon Glampers,"
said Hazel, "I'd have chimes on Sunday-just chimes. Kind of in honor of
religion."
"I could think, if it was just chimes," said George.
"Well-maybe make 'em real loud," said Hazel. "I think I'd make a good
Handicapper General."
"Good as anybody else," said George.
"Who knows better then I do what normal is?" said Hazel.
"Right," said George. He began to think glimmeringly about his abnormal son
who was now in jail, about Harrison, but a twenty-one-gun salute in his head
stopped that.
"Boy!" said Hazel, "that was a doozy, wasn't it?"
It was such a doozy that George was white and trembling, and tears stood on
the rims of his red eyes. Two of of the eight ballerinas had collapsed to the
studio floor, were holding their temples.
"All of a sudden you look so tired," said Hazel. "Why don't you stretch out
on the sofa, so's you can rest your handicap bag on the pillows, honeybunch."
She was referring to the forty-seven pounds of birdshot in a canvas bag,
which was padlocked around George's neck. "Go on and rest the bag for a
little while," she said. "I don't care if you're not equal to me for a
while."
George weighed the bag with his hands. "I don't mind it," he said. "I don't
notice it any more. It's just a part of me."
"You been so tired lately-kind of wore out," said Hazel. "If there was just
some way we could make a little hole in the bottom of the bag, and just take
out a few of them lead balls. Just a few."
"Two years in prison and two thousand dollars fine for every ball I took
out," said George. "I don't call that a bargain."
"If you could just take a few out when you came home from work," said Hazel.
"I mean-you don't compete with anybody around here. You just set around."
"If I tried to get away with it," said George, "then other people'd get away
with it-and pretty soon we'd be right back to the dark ages again, with
everybody competing against everybody else. You wouldn't like that, would
you?"
"I'd hate it," said Hazel.
"There you are," said George. The minute people start cheating on laws, what
do you think happens to society?"If Hazel hadn't been able to come up with an answer to this question, George
couldn't have supplied one. A siren was going off in his head.
"Reckon it'd fall all apart," said Hazel.
"What would?" said George blankly.
"Society," said Hazel uncertainly. "Wasn't that what you just said?
"Who knows?" said George.
The television program was suddenly interrupted for a news bulletin. It
wasn't clear at first as to what the bulletin was about, since the announcer,
like all announcers, had a serious speech impediment. For about half a
minute, and in a state of high excitement, the announcer tried to say,
"Ladies and Gentlemen."
He finally gave up, handed the bulletin to a ballerina to read.
"That's all right-" Hazel said of the announcer, "he tried. That's the big
thing. He tried to do the best he could with what God gave him. He should get
a nice raise for trying so hard."
"Ladies and Gentlemen," said the ballerina, reading the bulletin. She must
have been extraordinarily beautiful, because the mask she wore was hideous.
And it was easy to see that she was the strongest and most graceful of all
the dancers, for her handicap bags were as big as those worn by two-hundred
pound men.
And she had to apologize at once for her voice, which was a very unfair voice
for a woman to use. Her voice was a warm, luminous, timeless melody. "Excuse
me-" she said, and she began again, making her voice absolutely
uncompetitive.
"Harrison Bergeron, age fourteen," she said in a grackle squawk, "has just
escaped from jail, where he was held on suspicion of plotting to overthrow
the government. He is a genius and an athlete, is under-handicapped, and
should be regarded as extremely dangerous."
A police photograph of Harrison Bergeron was flashed on the screen-upside
down, then sideways, upside down again, then right side up. The picture
showed the full length of Harrison against a background calibrated in feet
and inches. He was exactly seven feet tall.
The rest of Harrison's appearance was Halloween and hardware. Nobody had ever
born heavier handicaps. He had outgrown hindrances faster than the H-G men
could think them up. Instead of a little ear radio for a mental handicap, he
wore a tremendous pair of earphones, and spectacles with thick wavy lenses.
The spectacles were intended to make him not only half blind, but to give him
whanging headaches besides.
Scrap metal was hung all over him. Ordinarily, there was a certain symmetry,
a military neatness to the handicaps issued to strong people, but Harrison
looked like a walking junkyard. In the race of life, Harrison carried three
hundred pounds.And to offset his good looks, the H-G men required that he wear at all times
a red rubber ball for a nose, keep his eyebrows shaved off, and cover his
even white teeth with black caps at snaggle-tooth random.
"If you see this boy," said the ballerina, "do not - I repeat, do not - try
to reason with him."
There was the shriek of a door being torn from its hinges.
Screams and barking cries of consternation came from the television set. The
photograph of Harrison Bergeron on the screen jumped again and again, as
though dancing to the tune of an earthquake.
George Bergeron correctly identified the earthquake, and well he might have –
for many was the time his own home had danced to the same crashing tune. "My
God-" said George, "that must be Harrison!"
The realization was blasted from his mind instantly by the sound of an
automobile collision in his head.
When George could open his eyes again, the photograph of Harrison was gone. A
living, breathing Harrison filled the screen.
Clanking, clownish, and huge, Harrison stood - in the center of the studio.
The knob of the uprooted studio door was still in his hand. Ballerinas,
technicians, musicians, and announcers cowered on their knees before him,
expecting to die.
"I am the Emperor!" cried Harrison. "Do you hear? I am the Emperor! Everybody
must do what I say at once!" He stamped his foot and the studio shook.
"Even as I stand here" he bellowed, "crippled, hobbled, sickened - I am a
greater ruler than any man who ever lived! Now watch me become what I can
become!"
Harrison tore the straps of his handicap harness like wet tissue paper, tore
straps guaranteed to support five thousand pounds.
Harrison's scrap-iron handicaps crashed to the floor.
Harrison thrust his thumbs under the bar of the padlock that secured his head
harness. The bar snapped like celery. Harrison smashed his headphones and
spectacles against the wall.
He flung away his rubber-ball nose, revealed a man that would have awed Thor,
the god of thunder.
"I shall now select my Empress!" he said, looking down on the cowering
people. "Let
the first woman who dares rise to her feet claim her mate and her throne!"
A moment passed, and then a ballerina arose, swaying like a willow.
Harrison plucked the mental handicap from her ear, snapped off her physical
handicaps with marvelous delicacy. Last of all he removed her mask.
She was blindingly beautiful."Now-" said Harrison, taking her hand, "shall we show the people the meaning
of the word dance? Music!" he commanded.
The musicians scrambled back into their chairs, and Harrison stripped them of
their handicaps, too. "Play your best," he told them, "and I'll make you
barons and dukes and earls."
The music began. It was normal at first-cheap, silly, false. But Harrison
snatched two musicians from their chairs, waved them like batons as he sang
the music as he wanted it played. He slammed them back into their chairs.
The music began again and was much improved.
Harrison and his Empress merely listened to the music for a while-listened
gravely, as though synchronizing their heartbeats with it.
They shifted their weights to their toes.
Harrison placed his big hands on the girls tiny waist, letting her sense the
weightlessness that would soon be hers.
And then, in an explosion of joy and grace, into the air they sprang!
Not only were the laws of the land abandoned, but the law of gravity and the
laws of motion as well.
They reeled, whirled, swiveled, flounced, capered, gamboled, and spun.
They leaped like deer on the moon.
The studio ceiling was thirty feet high, but each leap brought the dancers
nearer to it.
It became their obvious intention to kiss the ceiling. They kissed it.
And then, neutraling gravity with love and pure will, they remained suspended
in air inches below the ceiling, and they kissed each other for a long, long
time.
It was then that Diana Moon Glampers, the Handicapper General, came into the
studio with a double-barreled ten-gauge shotgun. She fired twice, and the
Emperor and the Empress were dead before they hit the floor.
Diana Moon Glampers loaded the gun again. She aimed it at the musicians and
told them they had ten seconds to get their handicaps back on.
It was then that the Bergerons' television tube burned out.
Hazel turned to comment about the blackout to George. But George had gone out
into the kitchen for a can of beer.
George came back in with the beer, paused while a handicap signal shook him
up. And then he sat down again. "You been crying" he said to Hazel.
"Yup," she said."What about?" he said.
"I forget," she said. "Something real sad on television."
"What was it?" he said.
"It's all kind of mixed up in my mind," said Hazel.
"Forget sad things," said George.
"I always do," said Hazel.
"That's my girl," said George. He winced. There was the sound of a rivetting
gun in his head.
"Gee - I could tell that one was a doozy," said Hazel.
"You can say that again," said George.
"Gee-" said Hazel, "I could tell that one was a doozy."

          <p><em>By W.D. Valgardson</em></p>
          <p>The story follows a man who, on a Saturday, leaves his study and wanders through his suburban neighborhood, drawn by the smell of burning leaves and memories of his childhood. As he strolls through the neat, symmetrical streets, he becomes increasingly aware of the uniformity and lack of spontaneity in the surroundings. He notices small imperfections—broken sidewalks, stray wrappers, and fragments of fences—that contrast with the meticulously maintained homes, stirring a sense of unease in him.</p>
          <p>As he continues his aimless journey, the man becomes increasingly aware of the youth and activities around him, from gangs of young men in leather jackets to children playing recklessly in the streets. Despite his casual attire, he feels vulnerable in the environment and is conscious of maintaining an appearance of safety, even preparing excuses and strategies in case he is accosted. His wandering is a mix of nostalgia, anxiety, and self-preservation as he negotiates the contrast between his orderly life and the unpredictable surroundings.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, his daydreaming and focus on potential dangers distract him from the present, leading to a confrontation with a police officer. When the officer orders him to halt, he instinctively reaches for his wallet to show identification, signaling the final moment of his vulnerability. The story explores themes of identity, perception, and the tension between the controlled, familiar world and the unpredictable external environment, illustrating how societal expectations and personal fears shape human behavior.</p>

          <p><em>By Barbara L. Greenberg</em></p>
          <p>The story follows a parent who has long promised to tell their children “The Important Things.” When the children are young, they beg and plead, but the parent delays, insisting they will explain everything when the children are older. Years pass, and now the children are grown—tall, confident, and demanding—pressing the parent to finally fulfill the promise.</p>
          <p>Trying to respond, the parent offers facts about the world, advice about behavior, lessons about good and evil, and comforting sayings about hope and renewal. The parent even talks about pain, joy, and morality, but none of these answers satisfy the children. They push back, challenge the parent’s words, and dismiss the lessons as inadequate or obvious, showing how distant they’ve grown from the parent’s authority.</p>
          <p>Running out of answers, the parent reveals the most honest truth they have: that they will die someday, and that the children will too. But even this fails to impress the children, who already know it. The parent feels helpless and apologetic, while the children insist that a promise must be kept. In the end, they warn that if the parent cannot finally reveal the “important things,” they may force the answer, leaving the story on a dark, unsettling note about expectations, communication, and the fear of not knowing what truly matters.</p>

          <p>The story is set in the future, where children like Margie and Tommy are taught at home by mechanical teachers. Margie finds an old, yellowed book about traditional schools, which surprises her because in her time all learning is done on screens and lessons are tailored individually for each student. Tommy explains to Margie that in the past, children went to school in buildings with human teachers who taught many students at once, a concept that seems strange and amusing to them.</p>
          <p>As Margie reads about the old schools, she learns that students learned together, helped each other with homework, and shared experiences in a schoolyard. This system was very different from her own, where lessons are automated, individualized, and monitored by a mechanical teacher. Margie is fascinated by the idea that children could gather, interact, and enjoy learning together, something she has never experienced in her isolated, futuristic education.</p>
          <p>By the end of the story, Margie imagines the joy and excitement of the children in the old schools. She contrasts this with her own routine, where learning is mechanical and solitary. Although she continues her lesson with the mechanical teacher, Margie dreams about the “fun they had” in the past, appreciating the human interaction, laughter, and shared learning that the old schools provided.</p>

          <p><em>By Anton Chekhov</em></p>
          <p>It was twelve o'clock at night. Mitya Kuldarov, with an excited face and ruffled hair, flew into his parents' flat and hurriedly ran through all the rooms. His parents had already gone to bed, his sister was finishing the last page of a novel, and his schoolboy brothers were asleep. “Where have you come from?” cried his parents in amazement. “What is the matter with you?”</p>
          <p>Mitya laughed and sank into an armchair, so overcome by happiness that he could not stand. “It's incredible! You can't imagine! Look!” His sister jumped out of bed, threw a quilt around her, and went to her brother. The schoolboys woke up. “What's the matter? You don't look like yourself!” they asked. “It's because I am so delighted, Mamma! Now all Russia knows of me! Till now only you knew that there was a registration clerk called Dmitry Kuldarov, and now all Russia knows it! Mamma! Oh, Lord!” Mitya ran up and down the rooms, then sat down again. “Why, what has happened? Tell us sensibly!” asked his father. “You live like wild beasts, you don't read the newspapers, and if anything happens, it's all known at once! How happy I am! Oh, Lord! They have published my name!”</p>
          <p>Mitya pulled a copy of the paper from his pocket and gave it to his father, pointing to the marked passage. The father read aloud about Kuldarov being accidentally run over by a horse-drawn sledge but unharmed. “It was from the shaft, papa. Go on! Read the rest!” Mitya exclaimed. “They told me to foment the back of my head with cold water. You have read it now? Ah! So you see. Now it's all over Russia!” Seizing the paper, he folded it into his pocket. “I'll run round to the Makarovs and show it to them. I must show it to the Ivanitskys too. Goodbye!” He put on his cap with its cockade, joyful and triumphant, and ran into the street.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Lather and Nothing Else</h2>
          <p><em>By Hernando Téllez</em></p>
          <div style="white-space:pre-wrap;">
LATHER AND NOTHING ELSE

He came in without a word. I was stropping my best razor. And when I recognized him, I started to shake. But he did not notice. To cover my nervousness, I went on honing the razor. I tried the edge with the tip of my thumb and took another look at it against the light. Meanwhile, he was taking off his cartridge-studded belt with the pistol holster suspended from it. He put it on a hook in the wardrobe and hung his cap above it. Then he turned full around toward me and, loosening his tie, remarked, “It’s hot as the devil. I want a shave.” With that he took his seat. I estimated he had a four-days’ growth of beard—the four days he had been gone on the last foray after our men. His face looked burnt, tanned by the sun. I started to work carefully on the shaving soap. I scraped some slices from the cake, dropped them into the mug, then added a little lukewarm water, and stirred with the brush. The lather soon began to rise.

“The fellows in the troop must have just about as much beard as I.” I went on stirring up lather. “But we did very well, you know. We caught the leaders. Some of them we brought back dead; others are still alive. But they’ll all be dead soon.”

“How many did you take?” I asked.

“Fourteen. We had to go pretty far in to find them. But now they’re paying for it. And not one will escape; not a single one.” He leaned back in the chair when he saw the brush in my hand, full of lather. I had not yet put the sheet on him. I was certainly flustered. Taking a sheet from the drawer, I tied it around my customer’s neck. He went on talking. He evidently took it for granted that I was on the side of the existing regime.

“The people must have gotten a scare with what happened the other day,” he said.

“Yes,” I replied, as I finished tying the knot against his nape, which smelt of sweat.

“Good show, wasn’t it?”

“Very good,” I answered, turning my attention now to the brush.

The man closed his eyes wearily and awaited the cool caress of the lather. I had never had him so close before. The day he ordered the people to file through the schoolyard to look upon the four rebels hanging there, my path had crossed his briefly. But the sight of those mutilated bodies kept me from paying attention to the face of the man who had been directing it all and whom I now had in my hands. It was not a disagreeable face, certainly. And the beard, which aged him a bit, was not unbecoming. His name was Torres. Captain Torres. I started to lay on the first coat of lather. He kept his eyes closed.

“I would love to catch a nap,” he said, “but there’s a lot to be done this evening.” I lifted the brush and asked, with pretended indifference:

“A firing party?”

“Something of the sort,” he replied, “but slower.”

“All of them?”

“No, just a few.”

I went on lathering his face. My hands began to tremble again. The man could not be aware of this, which was lucky for me. But I wished he had not come in. Probably many of our men had seen him enter the shop. And with the enemy in my house I felt a certain responsibility. I would have to shave his beard just like any other, carefully, neatly, just as though he were a good customer, taking heed that not a single pore should emit a drop of blood. Seeing to it that the blade did not slip in the small whorls. Taking care that the skin was left clean, soft, shining, so that when I passed the back of my hand over it, not a single hair should be felt. Yes. I was secretly a revolutionary, but at the same time I was a conscientious barber, proud of the way I did my job. And that four-day beard presented a challenge.

I took up the razor, opened the handle wide, releasing the blade, and started to work, downward from one sideburn. The blade responded to perfection. The hair was tough and hard; not very long, but thick. Little by little the skin began to show through. The razor gave out its usual sound as it gathered up layers of soap mixed with bits of hair. I paused to wipe it clean, and taking up the strop once more went about improving its edge, for I am a painstaking barber. The man, who had kept his eyes closed, now opened them, put a hand out from under the sheet, felt of the part of his face that was emerging from the lather, and said to me, “Come at six o’clock this evening to the school.”

“Will it be like the other day?” I asked, stiff with horror.

“It may be even better,” he replied.

“What are you planning to do?”

“I’m not sure yet. But we’ll have a good time.”

Once more he leaned back and shut his eyes. I came closer, the razor on high.

“Are you going to punish all of them?” I timidly ventured.

“Yes, all of them.”

The lather was drying on his face. I must hurry. Through the mirror, I took a look at the street. It appeared about as usual: there was the grocery shop with two or three customers. Then I glanced at the clock: two-thirty. The razor kept descending. Now from the other sideburn downward. It was a blue beard, a thick one. He should let it grow like some poets, or some priests. It would suit him well. Many people would not recognize him. And that would be a good thing for him, I thought, as I went gently over all the throat line. At this point you really had to handle your blade skillfully, because the hair, while scantier, tended to fall into small whorls. It was a curly beard. The pores might open, minutely, in this area and let out a tiny drop of blood. A good barber like myself stakes his reputation on not permitting that to happen to any of his customers. And this was indeed a special customer. How many of ours had he sent to their death? How many had he mutilated? It was best not to think about it.

Torres did not know I was his enemy. Neither he nor the others knew it. It was a secret shared by very few, just because that made it possible for me to inform the revolutionaries about Torres’ activities in the town and what he planned to do every time he went on one of his raids to hunt down rebels. So it was going to be very difficult to explain how it was that I had him in my hands and then let him go in peace, alive, clean-shaven.

His beard had now almost entirely disappeared. He looked younger, several years younger than when he had come in. I suppose that always happens to men who enter and leave barbershops. Under the strokes of my razor Torres was rejuvenated; yes, because I am a good barber, the best in this town, and I say this in all modesty. A little more lather here under the chin, on the Adam’s apple, right near the great vein. How hot it is! Torres must be sweating just as I am. But he is not afraid. He is a tranquil man, who is not even giving thought to what he will do to his prisoners this evening. I, on the other hand, polishing his skin with this razor but avoiding the drawing of blood, careful with every stroke—I cannot keep my thoughts in order. Confound the hour he entered my shop! I am a revolutionary but not a murderer.

And it would be so easy to kill him. He deserves it. Or does he? No, damn it! No one deserves the sacrifice others make in becoming assassins. What is to be gained by it? Nothing. Others and still others keep coming, and the first kill the second, and then these kill the next, and so on until everything becomes a sea of blood. I could cut his throat, so, swish, swish! He would not even have time to moan, and with his eyes shut he would not even see the shine of the razor or the gleam in my eye. But I’m shaking like a regular murderer. From his throat a stream of blood would flow on the sheet, over the chair, down on my hands, onto the floor. I would have to close the door. But the blood would go flowing, along the floor, warm, indelible, not to be stanched, until it reached the street, like a small scarlet river. I’m sure that with a good strong blow, a deep cut, he would feel no pain. He would not suffer at all. And what would I do then with the body? Where would I hide it? I would have to flee, leave all this behind, take shelter far away, very far away. But they would follow until they caught up with me.

“The murderer of Captain Torres. He slit his throat while he was shaving him. What a cowardly thing to do!” And others would say, “The avenger of our people. A name to remember”—my name here. “He was the town barber. No one knew he was fighting for our cause.” And so, which will it be? Murderer or hero? My fate hangs on the edge of this razor blade.

I can turn my wrist slightly, put a bit more pressure on the blade, let it sink in. The skin will yield like silk, like rubber, like the strop. There is nothing more tender than a man’s skin, and the blood is always there, ready to burst forth. A razor like this cannot fail. It is the best one I have. But I don’t want to be a murderer. No, sir. You came in to be shaved. And I do my work honorably. I don’t want to stain my hands with blood. Just with lather, and nothing else. You are an executioner; I am only a barber. Each one to his job. That’s it. Each one to his job.

The chin was now clean, polished, soft. The man got up and looked at himself in the glass. He ran his hand over the skin and felt its freshness, its newness.

“Thanks,” he said.

He walked to the wardrobe for his belt, his pistol, and his cap. I must have been very pale, and I felt my shirt soaked with sweat. Torres finished adjusting his belt buckle, straightened his gun in its holster, and, smoothing his hair mechanically, put on his cap. From his trousers pocket he took some coins to pay for the shave. And he started toward the door.

On the threshold he stopped for a moment, and turning toward me he said: “They told me you would kill me. I came to find out if it was true. But it’s not easy to kill. I know what I’m talking about.”

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">One Of These Days</h2>
          <p><em>By Gabriel García Márquez</em></p>
          <div style="white-space:pre-wrap;">
Monday dawned warm and rainless. Aurelio Escovar, a dentist
without a degree, and a very early riser, opened his oﬃce at six.
He took some false teeth, still mounted in their plaster mold,
out of the glass case and put on the table a fistful of instruments which he
arranged in size order, as if they were on display. He wore a collarless striped
shirt, closed at the neck with a golden stud, and pants held up by suspend-
ers. He was erect and skinny, with a look that rarely corresponded to the
situation, the way deaf people have of looking.

When he had things arranged on the table, he pulled the drill toward the
dental chair and sat down to polish the false teeth. He seemed not to be
thinking about what he was doing, but worked steadily, pumping the drill
with his feet, even when he didn’t need it.

After eight he stopped for a while to look at the sky through the window,
and he saw two pensive buzzards who were drying themselves in the sun on
the ridgepole of the house next door. He went on working with the idea
that before lunch it would rain again. The shrill voice of his eleven-year-old
son interrupted his concentration.

“Papa.”

“What?”

“The Mayor wants to know if you’ll pull his tooth.”

“Tell him I’m not here.”

He was polishing a gold tooth. He held it at arm’s length, and examined it
with his eyes half closed. His son shouted again from the little waiting
room.

“He says you are, too, because he can hear you.”

The dentist kept examining the tooth. Only when he had put it on the
table with the finished work did he say:

“So much the better.”

He operated the drill again. He took several pieces of a bridge out of a
cardboard box where he kept the things he still had to do and began to pol-
ish the gold.

“Papa.”

“What?”

He still hadn’t changed his expression.

“He says if you don’t take out his tooth, he’ll shoot you.”

Without hurrying, with an extremely tranquil movement, he stopped
pedaling the drill, pushed it away from the chair, and pulled the lower
drawer of the table all the way out. There was a revolver. “O.K.,” he said.

“Tell him to come and shoot me.”

He rolled the chair over opposite the door, his hand resting on the edge of
the drawer. The Mayor appeared at the door. He had shaved the left side of
his face, but the other side, swollen and in pain, had a five-day-old beard.
The dentist saw many nights of desperation in his dull eyes. He closed the
drawer with his fingertips and said softly:

“Sit down.”

“Good morning,” said the Mayor.

“Morning,” said the dentist.

While the instruments were boiling, the Mayor leaned his skull on the
headrest of the chair and felt better. His breath was icy. It was a poor oﬃce:
an old wooden chair, the pedal drill, a glass case with ceramic bottles. Op-
posite the chair was a window with a shoulder-high cloth curtain. When he
felt the dentist approach, the Mayor braced his heels and opened his mouth.

Aurelio Escovar turned his head toward the light. After inspecting the in-
fected tooth, he closed the Mayor’s jaw with a cautious pressure of his fin-
gers.

“It has to be without anesthesia,” he said.

“Why?”

“Because you have an abscess.”

The Mayor looked him in the eye. “All right,” he said, and tried to smile.

The dentist did not return the smile. He brought the basin of sterilized in-
struments to the worktable and took them out of the water with a pair of
cold tweezers, still without hurrying. Then he pushed the spittoon with the
tip of his shoe, and went to wash his hands in the washbasin. He did all this
without looking at the Mayor. But the Mayor didn’t take his eyes oﬀ him.

It was a lower wisdom tooth. The dentist spread his feet and grasped the
tooth with the hot forceps. The Mayor seized the arms of the chair, braced
his feet with all his strength, and felt an icy void in his kidneys, but didn’t
make a sound. The dentist moved only his wrist. Without rancor, rather
with a bitter tenderness, he said:

“Now you’ll pay for our twenty dead men.”

The Mayor felt the crunch of bones in his jaw, and his eyes filled with
tears. But he didn’t breathe until he felt the tooth come out. Then he saw it
through his tears. It seemed so foreign to his pain that he failed to under-
stand his torture of the five previous nights.

Bent over the spittoon, sweating, panting, he unbuttoned his tunic and
reached for the handkerchief in his pants pocket. The dentist gave him a
clean cloth.

“Dry your tears,” he said.

The Mayor did. He was trembling. While the dentist washed his hands,
he saw the crumbling ceiling and a dusty spider web with spider’s eggs and
dead insects. The dentist returned, drying his hands. “Go to bed,” he said,
“and gargle with salt water.” The Mayor stood up, said goodbye with a cas-
ual military salute, and walked toward the door, stretching his legs, without
buttoning up his tunic.

“Send the bill,” he said.

“To you or the town?”

The Mayor didn’t look at him. He closed the door and said through the
screen:

“It’s the same damn thing.”

          <div style="white-space:pre-wrap;">
Early that day the weather turned and the snow was melting into dirty water. Streaks of it ran down from the little shoulder-high window that faced the backyard. Cars slushed by on the street outside, where it was getting dark. But it was getting dark on the inside too.
He was in the bedroom pushing clothes into a suitcase when she came to the door.
I’m glad you’re leaving! I’m glad you’re leaving! she said. Do you hear?
He kept on putting his things into the suitcase.
Son of a bitch! I’m so glad you’re leaving! She began to cry. You can’t even look me in the face, can you?
Then she noticed the baby’s picture on the bed and picked it up.
He looked at her and she wiped her eyes and stared at him before turning and going back to the living room.
Bring that back, he said.
Just get your things and get out, she said.
He did not answer. He fastened the suitcase, put on his coat, looked around the bedroom before turning off the light. Then he went out to the living room.
She stood in the doorway of the little kitchen, holding the baby.
I want the baby, he said.
Are you crazy?
No, but I want the baby. I’ll get someone to come for his things.
You’re not touching this baby, she said. The baby had begun to cry and she uncovered the blanket from around his head.
Oh, oh, she said, looking at the baby.
He moved toward her.
For God’s sake! she said. She took a step back into the kitchen.
I want the baby.
Get out of here!
She turned and tried to hold the baby over in a corner behind the stove.
But he came up. He reached across the stove and tightened his hands on the baby.
Let go of him, he said.
Get away, get away! she cried.
The baby was red-faced and screaming. In the scuffle they knocked down a flowerpot that hung behind the stove. He crowded her into the wall then, trying to break her grip. He held onto the baby and pushed with all his weight.
Let go of him, he said.
Don’t, she said. You’re hurting the baby, she said.
I’m not hurting the baby, he said.
The kitchen window gave no light. In the near dark he worked on her fisted fingers with one hand and with the other hand he gripped the screaming baby up under an arm near the shoulder.
She felt her fingers being forced open. She felt the baby going from her.
No! she screamed just as her hands came loose.
She would have it, this baby. She grabbed for the baby’s other arm. She caught the baby around the wrist and leaned back.
But he would not let go. He felt the baby slipping out of his hands and he pulled back very hard.
In this manner, the issue was decided.

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Skipper (The Last of Her Sons)</h2>
          <p><em>By Alden Nowlan</em></p>
          <p>Skipper is the youngest of five sons of Ethel and Judd Syverson. As a child, he shares a quiet, protective bond with his mother, while fearing and resenting his harsh, hard-working father. Judd is demanding and abusive, particularly when drunk, while Ethel nurtures Skipper’s gentler qualities, encouraging his creativity, love of books, and dreams of a future beyond the sawmill life that has trapped his older brothers. From a young age, Skipper vows to avoid alcohol, reflecting his rejection of his father’s destructive habits.</p>

          <p>Ethel places her hopes in Skipper, believing he might escape the cycle of hard labor, drinking, and early family responsibility that consumed his older siblings. She encourages his daydreams of becoming a gentleman and a man of culture, hoping he will achieve something better and take her with him.</p>
          <p>Despite Skipper’s occasional missteps, like killing a sparrow or experimenting with his father’s rifle, Ethel clings to the belief that he will follow a different path, nurturing his talents and sensitivity while preparing him for life beyond the mill.</p>

          <p>As Skipper reaches adolescence, however, he begins to embrace the behaviors of the older boys. One Saturday night, he returns from town having drunk alcohol and expresses interest in working at the mill like the others. Ethel is heartbroken, realizing her son is succumbing to the same path she hoped he would avoid. The story ends with the subtle, bittersweet image of Skipper and Judd laughing together in the kitchen, marking the inevitable continuation of the cycle she had tried so hard to prevent.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">There Was Once</h2>
          <p>The story begins with a traditional fairy tale setup about a girl living with her wicked stepmother. However, the narrator’s retelling is constantly interrupted and challenged by a critical voice that questions every detail, from the setting and social class to the girl’s appearance and the morality of the characters. Each attempt to describe the girl or the stepmother is met with scrutiny, forcing the narrator to revise the story repeatedly. The critiques highlight issues of modern social awareness, including gender roles, race, and socio-economic context, emphasizing that the original tale’s simplicity and moral absolutes are outdated.</p>

          <p>As the story progresses, the girl’s characterization is altered multiple times to satisfy the critical voice. She is changed from poor to middle-class, from beautiful to average-looking, and from morally good to well-adjusted, while the stepmother’s wickedness is softened by acknowledging her own difficult past. The critical voice also insists on contemporary ethical and cultural considerations, questioning stereotypes and the use of traditional moral judgments such as “good” and “wicked.”</p>

          <p>The repeated interruptions illustrate the tension between storytelling tradition and the pressures of modern social and political correctness.
Ultimately, the narrative becomes a reflection on the difficulty of telling stories in a world that demands constant self-awareness and ethical scrutiny. The original plot—a girl overcoming adversity and finding happiness—is never fully realized because the focus shifts to debates over language, identity, and representation. The story ends unresolved, emphasizing how contemporary critiques can overshadow narrative simplicity, leaving the fairy tale suspended between past conventions and present sensibilities.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">The Awful Fate of Melpomenus Jones</h2>
          <p><em>By H.G. Wells</em></p>
          <p>Melpomenus Jones, a timid and overly polite young curate, struggles with saying goodbye when visiting a family at the start of his summer vacation. Despite his intentions to leave, he is repeatedly persuaded to stay longer, drinking many cups of tea and being shown countless family photographs. Each time he tries to depart, some circumstance or request keeps him there, and he grows increasingly anxious and miserable.</p>

          <p>As days pass, Jones remains in the household, unable to assert himself or leave, even after the family’s father jokingly threatens to charge him for his board. He becomes moody, withdrawn, and spends his time endlessly drinking tea and obsessively staring at the photographs. His mental and physical health deteriorates under the strain of constant social obligations and his own inability to act decisively.</p>

          <p>Eventually, Jones falls into a raging delirium, speaking repeatedly about wanting more tea and photographs, showing that his mind is overwhelmed. After a month of suffering, on the last day of his vacation, he dies peacefully, smiling and saying goodbye as if answering a heavenly call. His death reflects the tragic consequences of extreme politeness, timidity, and the social pressures that ensnared him.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">The Golden Kite, the Silver Wind</h2>
          <p>The story is set in two neighboring towns, each ruled by a Mandarin, whose citizens are deeply influenced by omens and the shapes of their city walls. When the town of Kwan-Si builds its walls in the shape of a pig, the Mandarin of the other town, whose walls are shaped like an orange, fears that they will be overpowered. Following the advice of his clever daughter, the Mandarin orders his stone-masons to reshape their walls into a club to counter the pig. This begins a cycle of competitive reconstruction, with each town continually changing the shapes of their walls in response to the other’s designs.</p>

          <p>As the rivalry escalates, the townspeople suffer exhaustion, poverty, and sickness, devoting all their time to reshaping walls instead of tending to their daily lives, crops, or families. The Mandarins themselves grow weak, and the conflict seems endless, as each new wall shape by one town prompts an immediate response by the other. The story highlights the futility and destructive consequences of competition driven by fear and pride.</p>

          <p>Ultimately, the Mandarin’s daughter proposes a solution that ends the destructive cycle: instead of creating walls to dominate each other, each town should build in cooperation with the natural elements. One town becomes the “Golden Kite” and the other the “Silver Wind,” working together in harmony. The walls now symbolize beauty, collaboration, and interdependence, restoring peace, health, and prosperity to both towns. The story concludes with a message about cooperation, balance, and the creative power of working together rather than against one another.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">The Key Game</h2>
          <p><em>By Ida Fink</em></p>
          <p>The story takes place in a small, gloomy apartment during wartime, where a family of three—mother, father, and their young blue-eyed son—has been living after fleeing previous homes. Their lives are tense and constrained, and they have developed a ritualized “key game” to prepare the child for emergencies. The boy’s mother encourages him gently, while the father, nervous and anxious, practices precise movements to simulate hiding or escaping through the apartment.</p>

          <p>Every evening, the family meticulously rehearses the game. The boy’s task is to retrieve the keys and perform actions at the door, while the father navigates tight spaces and the mother observes. Though the game appears ordinary, it carries an undercurrent of fear and survival, reflecting the harsh realities of wartime life and the family’s need to train the child to respond to unexpected visitors or threats. At the conclusion, the tension between preparation and reality is revealed: the father’s “practice” hints at the ultimate danger that surrounds them. The boy responds to his father’s questions mechanically, demonstrating how the child has been conditioned for survival.</p>

          <p>The story ends with a chilling reminder of the family’s vulnerability: the father is already dead to the outsiders who might come to the door, leaving only the trained child to act as if the household is safe.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">The Lottery</h2>
          <p><em>By Shirley Jackson</em></p>

          <p>The morning of June 27th was clear and sunny, with the fresh warmth of a full-summer day; the flowers were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green. The people of the village began to gather in the square, between the post office and the bank, around ten o’clock. In some towns there were so many people that the lottery took two days and had to be started on June 26th, but in this village, where there were only about three hundred people, the whole lottery took less than two hours, so it could begin at ten o’clock in the morning and still be through in time to allow the villagers to get home for noon dinner.</p>

          <p>The children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and the feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them. They tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke into boisterous play, and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands. Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his example, selecting the smoothest and roundest stones. Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix—the villagers pronounced this name “Dellacroy”—eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls stood aside, talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at the boys, and the very small children rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters.</p>

          <p>Soon the men began to gather, surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors and taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under his mother’s grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest brother.</p>

          <p>The lottery was conducted—as were the square dances, the teenage club, the Halloween program—by Mr. Summers, who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. He was a round-faced, jovial man and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him, because he had no children and his wife was a scold. When he arrived in the square, carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers, and he waved and called: “Little late today, folks.” The postmaster, Mr. Graves, followed him, carrying a three-legged stool, and the stool was put in the center of the square and Mr. Summers set the black box down on it. The villagers kept their distance, leaving a space between themselves and the stool. And when Mr. Summers said, “Some of you fellows want to give me a hand?” there was a hesitation before two men, Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, came forward to hold the box steady on the stool while Mr. Summers stirred up the papers inside it.</p>

          <p>The original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago, and the black box now resting on the stool had been put into use even before Old Man Warner, the oldest man in town, was born. Mr. Summers spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box, but no one liked to upset even as much tradition as was represented by the black box. There was a story that the present box had been made with some pieces of the box that had preceded it, the one that had been constructed when the first people settled down to make a village here. Every year, after the lottery, Mr. Summers began talking again about a new box, but every year the subject was allowed to fade off without anything’s being done. The black box grew shabbier each year. By now it was no longer completely black but splintered badly along one side to show the original wood color, and in some places faded or stained.</p>

          <p>Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, held the black box securely on the stool until Mr. Summers had stirred the papers thoroughly with his hand. Because so much of the ritual had been forgotten or discarded, Mr. Summers had been successful in having slips of paper substituted for the chips of wood that had been used for generations. Chips of wood, Mr. Summers had argued, had been all very well when the village was tiny, but now that the population was more than three hundred and likely to keep on growing, it was necessary to use something that would fit more easily into the black box. The night before the lottery, Mr. Summers and Mr. Graves made up the slips of paper and put them in the box, and it was then taken to the safe of Mr. Summers’ coal company and locked up until Mr. Summers was ready to take it to the square next morning. The rest of the year, the box was put away, sometimes one place, sometimes another; it had spent one year in Mr. Graves’s barn and another year underfoot in the post office, and sometimes it was set on a shelf in the Martin grocery and left there.</p>

          <p>There was a great deal of fussing to be done before Mr. Summers declared the lottery open. There were the lists to make up—of heads of families, heads of households in each family, members of each household in each family. There was the proper swearing-in of Mr. Summers by the postmaster, as the official of the lottery; at one time, some people remembered, there had been a recital of some sort, performed by the official of the lottery, a perfunctory, tuneless chant that had been rattled off duly each year. Some people believed that the official of the lottery used to stand just so when he said or sang it, others believed that he was supposed to walk among the people, but years and years ago this part of the ritual had been allowed to lapse. There had been, also, a ritual salute, which the official of the lottery had had to use in addressing each person who came up to draw from the box, but this also had changed with time, until now it was felt necessary only for the official to speak to each person approaching. Mr. Summers was very good at all this; in his clean white shirt and blue jeans, with one hand resting carelessly on the black box, he seemed very proper and important as he talked interminably to Mr. Graves and the Martins.</p>

          <p>Just as Mr. Summers finally left off talking and turned to the assembled villagers, Mrs. Hutchinson came hurriedly along the path to the square, her sweater thrown over her shoulders, and slid into place in the back of the crowd. “Clean forgot what day it was,” she said to Mrs. Delacroix, who stood next to her, and they both laughed softly. “Thought my old man was out back stacking wood,” Mrs. Hutchinson went on, “and then I looked out the window and the kids was gone, and then I remembered it was the twenty-seventh and came a-running.” She dried her hands on her apron, and Mrs. Delacroix said, “You’re in time, though. They’re still talking away up there.”</p>

          <p>Mrs. Hutchinson craned her neck to see through the crowd and found her husband and children standing near the front. She tapped Mrs. Delacroix on the arm as a farewell and began to make her way through the crowd. The people separated good-humoredly to let her through. Two or three people said, in voices just loud enough to be heard across the crowd, “Here comes your Missus, Hutchinson,” and “Bill, she made it after all.” Mrs. Hutchinson reached her husband, and Mr. Summers, who had been waiting, said cheerfully, “Thought we were going to have to get on without you, Tessie.” Mrs. Hutchinson said, grinning, “Wouldn’t have me leave m’dishes in the sink, now, would you, Joe?” and soft laughter ran through the crowd as the people stirred back into position after Mrs. Hutchinson’s arrival.</p>

          <p>“Well, now,” Mr. Summers said soberly, “guess we better get started, get this over with, so’s we can go back to work. Anybody ain’t here?” “Dunbar,” several people said. “Dunbar. Dunbar.” Mr. Summers consulted his list. “Clyde Dunbar,” he said. “That’s right. He’s broke his leg, hasn’t he? Who’s drawing for him?” “Me, I guess,” a woman said, and Mr. Summers turned to look at her. “Wife draws for her husband,” Mr. Summers said. “Don’t you have a grown boy to do it for you, Janey?” Although Mr. Summers and everyone else in the village knew the answer perfectly well, it was the business of the official of the lottery to ask such questions formally. Mr. Summers waited with an expression of polite interest while Mrs. Dunbar answered. “Horace’s not but sixteen yet,” Mrs. Dunbar said regretfully. “Guess I gotta fill in for the old man this year.” “Right,” Mr. Summers said. He made a note on the list he was holding. Then he asked, “Watson boy drawing this year?” A tall boy in the crowd raised his hand. “Here,” he said. “I’m drawing for my mother and me.” He blinked his eyes nervously and ducked his head as several voices in the crowd said things like “Good fellow, Jack,” and “Glad to see your mother’s got a man to do it.” “Well,” Mr. Summers said, “guess that’s everyone. Old Man Warner make it?” “Here,” a voice said and Mr. Summers nodded.</p>

          <p>A sudden hush fell on the crowd as Mr. Summers cleared his throat and looked at the list. “All ready?” he called. “Now, I’ll read the names—heads of families first—and the men come up and take a paper out of the box. Keep the paper folded in your hand without looking at it until everyone has had a turn. Everything clear?” The people had done it so many times that they only half listened to the directions. Most of them were quiet, wetting their lips, not looking around. Then Mr. Summers raised one hand high and said, “Adams.” A man disengaged himself from the crowd and came forward. “Hi Steve,” Mr. Summers said and Mr. Adams said, “Hi Joe.” They grinned at one another humorlessly and nervously. Then Mr. Adams reached into the black box and took out a folded paper. He held it firmly by one corner as he turned and went hastily back to his place in the crowd, where he stood a little apart from his family, not looking down at his hand. “Allen,” Mr. Summers said. “Anderson… Bentham.”</p>

          <p>“Seems like there’s no time at all between lotteries any more,” Mrs. Delacroix said to Mrs. Graves in the back row. “Seems like we got through with the last one only last week.” “Time sure goes fast,” Mrs. Graves said. “Clark… Delacroix.” “There goes my old man,” Mrs. Delacroix said. She held her breath while her husband went forward. “Dunbar,” Mr. Summers said, and Mrs. Dunbar went steadily to the box while one of the women said, “Go on, Janey,” and another said, “There she goes.” “We’re next,” Mrs. Graves said. She watched while Mr. Graves came around from the side of the box, greeted Mr. Summers gravely and selected a slip of paper from the box. By now, all through the crowd there were men holding the small folded papers in their large hands, turning them over and over nervously. Mrs. Dunbar and her two sons stood together, Mrs. Dunbar holding the slip of paper. “Harburt… Hutchinson.” “Get up there, Bill,” Mrs. Hutchinson said, and the people near her laughed. “Jones.”</p>

          <p>“They do say,” Mr. Adams said to Old Man Warner, who stood next to him, “that over in the north village they’re talking of giving up the lottery.” Old Man Warner snorted. “Pack of crazy fools,” he said. “Listening to the young folks, nothing’s good enough for them. Next thing you know, they’ll be wanting to go back to living in caves, nobody work any more, live that way for a while. Used to be a saying about ‘Lottery in June, corn be heavy soon.’ First thing you know, we’d all be eating stewed chickweed and acorns. There’s always been a lottery,” he added petulantly. “Bad enough to see young Joe Summers up there joking with everybody.” “Some places have already quit lotteries,” Mrs. Adams said. “Nothing but trouble in that,” Old Man Warner said stoutly. “Pack of young fools.” “Martin.” And Bobby Martin watched his father go forward. “Overdyke… Percy.” “I wish they’d hurry,” Mrs. Dunbar said to her older son. “I wish they’d hurry.” “They’re almost through,” her son said. “You get ready to run tell Dad,” Mrs. Dunbar said. Mr. Summers called his own name and then stepped forward precisely and selected a slip from the box. Then he called, “Warner.” “Seventy-seventh year I been in the lottery,” Old Man Warner said as he went through the crowd. “Seventy-seventh time.” “Watson.” The tall boy came awkwardly through the crowd. Someone said, “Don’t be nervous, Jack,” and Mr. Summers said, “Take your time, son.” “Zanini.”</p>

          <p>After that, there was a long pause, a breathless pause, until Mr. Summers, holding his slip of paper in the air, said, “All right, fellows.” For a minute, no one moved, and then all the slips of paper were opened. Suddenly, all the women began to speak at once, saying, “Who is it?,” “Who’s got it?,” “Is it the Dunbars?,” “Is it the Watsons?” Then the voices began to say, “It’s Hutchinson. It’s Bill,” “Bill Hutchinson’s got it.” “Go tell your father,” Mrs. Dunbar said to her older son. People began to look around to see the Hutchinsons. Bill Hutchinson was standing quiet, staring down at the paper in his hand. Suddenly, Tessie Hutchinson shouted to Mr. Summers, “You didn’t give him time enough to take any paper he wanted. I saw you. It wasn’t fair!” “Be a good sport, Tessie,” Mrs. Delacroix called, and Mrs. Graves said, “All of us took the same chance.” “Shut up, Tessie,” Bill Hutchinson said.</p>

          <p>“Well, everyone,” Mr. Summers said, “that was done pretty fast, and now we’ve got to be hurrying a little more to get done in time.” He consulted his next list. “Bill,” he said, “you draw for the Hutchinson family. You got any other households in the Hutchinsons?” “There’s Don and Eva,” Mrs. Hutchinson yelled. “Make them take their chance!” “Daughters draw with their husbands’ families, Tessie,” Mr. Summers said gently. “You know that as well as anyone else.” “It wasn’t fair,” Tessie said. “I guess not, Joe,” Bill Hutchinson said regretfully. “My daughter draws with her husband’s family; that’s only fair. And I’ve got no other family except the kids.” “Then, as far as drawing for families is concerned, it’s you,” Mr. Summers said in explanation, “and as far as drawing for households is concerned, that’s you, too. Right?” “Right,” Bill Hutchinson said. “How many kids, Bill?” Mr. Summers asked formally. “Three,” Bill Hutchinson said. “There’s Bill Jr., and Nancy, and little Dave. And Tessie and me.” “All right, then,” Mr. Summers said. “Harry, you got their tickets back?” Mr. Graves nodded and held up the slips of paper. “Put them in the box, then,” Mr. Summers directed. “Take Bill’s and put it in.” “I think we ought to start over,” Mrs. Hutchinson said, as quietly as she could. “I tell you it wasn’t fair. You didn’t give him time enough to choose. Everybody saw that.” Mr. Graves had selected the five slips and put them in the box, and he dropped all the papers but those onto the ground, where the breeze caught them and lifted them off.</p>

          <p>“Listen, everybody,” Mrs. Hutchinson was saying to the people around her. “Ready, Bill?” Mr. Summers asked, and Bill Hutchinson, with one quick glance around at his wife and children, nodded. “Remember,” Mr. Summers said, “take the slips and keep them folded until each person has taken one. Harry, you help little Dave.” Mr. Graves took the hand of the little boy, who came willingly with him up to the box. “Take a paper out of the box, Davy,” Mr. Summers said. Davy put his hand into the box and laughed. “Take just one paper,” Mr. Summers said. “Harry, you hold it for him.” Mr. Graves took the child’s hand and removed the folded paper from the tight fist and held it while little Dave stood next to him and looked up at him wonderingly. “Nancy next,” Mr. Summers said. Nancy was twelve, and her school friends breathed heavily as she went forward, switching her skirt, and took a slip daintily from the box. “Bill Jr.,” Mr. Summers said, and Billy, his face red and his feet overlarge, near knocked the box over as he got a paper out. “Tessie,” Mr. Summers said. She hesitated for a minute, looking around defiantly, and then set her lips and went up to the box. She snatched a paper out and held it behind her. “Bill,” Mr. Summers said, and Bill Hutchinson reached into the box and felt around, bringing his hand out at last with the slip of paper in it.</p>

          <p>The crowd was quiet. A girl whispered, “I hope it’s not Nancy,” and the sound of the whisper reached the edges of the crowd. “It’s not the way it used to be,” Old Man Warner said clearly. “People ain’t the way they used to be.” “All right,” Mr. Summers said. “Open the papers. Harry, you open little Dave’s.” Mr. Graves opened the slip of paper and there was a general sigh through the crowd as he held it up and everyone could see that it was blank. Nancy and Bill Jr. opened theirs at the same time and both beamed and laughed, turning around to the crowd and holding their slips of paper above their heads. “Tessie,” Mr. Summers said. There was a pause, and then Mr. Summers looked at Bill Hutchinson. Bill unfolded his paper and showed it. It was blank. “It’s Tessie,” Mr. Summers said, and his voice was hushed. “Show us her paper, Bill.” Bill Hutchinson went over to his wife and forced the slip of paper out of her hand. It had a black spot on it, the black spot Mr. Summers had made the night before with the heavy pencil in the coal company office. Bill Hutchinson held it up, and there was a stir in the crowd. “All right, folks,” Mr. Summers said, “Let’s finish quickly.”</p>

          <p>Although the villagers had forgotten the ritual and lost the original black box, they still remembered to use stones. The pile of stones the boys had made earlier was ready. There were stones on the ground with the blowing scraps of paper that had come out of the box. Mrs. Delacroix selected a stone so large she had to pick it up with both hands and turned to Mrs. Dunbar. “Come on,” she said, “Hurry up.” Mrs. Dunbar had small stones in both hands, and she said, gasping for breath, “I can’t run at all. You’ll have to go ahead and I’ll catch up with you.” The children had stones already. And someone gave little Davy Hutchinson a few pebbles. Tessie Hutchinson was in the center of a cleared space by now, and she held her hands out desperately as the villagers moved in on her. “It isn’t fair,” she said. A stone hit her on the side of the head. Old Man Warner was saying, “Come on, come on, everyone.” Steve Adams was in the front of the crowd of villagers, with Mrs. Graves beside him. “It isn’t fair, it isn’t right,” Mrs. Hutchinson screamed, and then they were upon her.</p>

          <p><em>By Oscar Wilde</em></p>

          <p>Hughie Erskine was a charming but financially ineffectual young man who lived on a small allowance from an old aunt. Despite his good looks, popularity, and numerous accomplishments, he could not earn a living. Hughie had tried various professions, from stock trading to selling sherry, but none suited him. On top of this, he was deeply in love with Laura Merton, the daughter of a retired Colonel, whose father would not permit their engagement until Hughie had ten thousand pounds of his own.</p>

          <p>Hughie’s friend, Alan Trevor, was a painter and artist known for his talent and sought-after work. Trevor appreciated Hughie not only for his charm and personal beauty but also for his bright, generous, and reckless nature. This friendship granted Hughie access to Trevor’s studio, where the young man often visited. Trevor’s philosophy was that artists should surround themselves with people who are pleasing both to the eye and the mind.</p>

          <p>One day, Hughie visited Trevor’s studio to find him completing a life-size painting of a beggar-man, who was present in the studio, standing on a raised platform. The beggar was an old, wizened man with a face full of wrinkles and a pitiable expression. This encounter sets the stage for the story’s exploration of generosity, appearances, and the surprising ways true character can reveal itself.</p>

          <p>Alice and her husband, Marc, go to a seaside restaurant for lunch. Marc deliberately chooses a table in the middle of the room, rather than by the window, to prevent Alice from sitting near his ex-wife, who is also staying at the hotel. When Alice notices the woman, curiosity and unease stir within her, but Marc reassures her that his previous marriage ended amicably and that he is now fully devoted to her.</p>

          <p>During their meal, Alice and Marc share an affectionate and lively conversation, enjoying each other’s company. Marc praises Alice’s beauty and charm, while Alice occasionally sneaks glances at the ex-wife, observing her calm, composed, and somewhat dissatisfied demeanor. Despite the ex-wife’s presence, the couple continues to eat and drink heartily, immersed in their shared happiness.</p>

          <p>As they leave the restaurant, Alice reflects on the contrast between herself and the ex-wife. She wonders why the other woman seemed so dissatisfied and what she might have wanted from Marc. The story closes with Alice feeling both envy and curiosity, recognizing the subtle complexities of love, memory, and the delicate nature of marital happiness.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">The Possibility of Evil</h2>
          <p><em>By Shirley Jackson</em></p>

          <p>Miss Adela Strangeworth stepped daintily along Main Street on her way to the grocery. The sun was shining, the air was fresh and clear after the night’s heavy rain, and everything in Miss Strangeworth’s little town looked washed and bright. Miss Strangeworth took deep breaths, and thought that there was nothing in the world like a fragrant summer day.</p>

          <p>She knew everyone in town, of course; she was fond of telling strangers—tourists who sometimes passed through the town and stopped to admire Miss Strangeworth’s roses—that she had never spent more than a day outside this town in all her long life. She was seventy-one, Miss Strangeworth told the tourists, with a pretty little dimple showing by her lip, and she sometimes found herself thinking that the town belonged to her. “My grandfather built the first house on Pleasant Street,” she would say, opening her blue eyes with the wonder of it. This house, right here. My family has lived here for better than a hundred years. My grandmother planted these roses, and my mother tended them, just as I do.”…</p>

          <p>Miss Strangeworth never gave away any of her roses, although the tourists often asked her. The roses belonged on Pleasant Street, and it bothered Miss Strangeworth to think of people wanting to carry them away, to take them into strange towns and down strange streets.…</p>

          <p>Walking down Main Street on a summer morning, Miss Strangeworth had to stop every minute or so to say good morning to someone or to ask after someone’s health. When she came into the grocery, half a dozen people turned away from the shelves and counters to wave at her or call out good morning. “And good morning to you, Mr. Lewis,” Miss Strangeworth said at last… “Good morning,” Mr. Lewis said, and added politely, “lovely day.” “It is a very nice day,” Miss Strangeworth said as though she had only just decided that it would do after all. “I would like a chop, please, Mr. Lewis, a small, lean veal chop. Are those strawberries from Arthur Parker’s garden? They’re early this year.” “He brought them in this morning,” Mr. Lewis said. “I shall have a box,” Miss Strangeworth said. Mr. Lewis looked worried, she thought, and for a minute she hesitated, but then she decided that he surely could not be worried over the strawberries. He looked very tired indeed.… “And a can of cat food and, I think, a tomato.”</p>

          <p>Silently, Mr. Lewis assembled her order on the counter and waited. Miss Strangeworth looked at him curiously and then said, “It’s Tuesday, Mr. Lewis. You forgot to remind me.” “Did I? Sorry.” “Imagine your forgetting that I always buy my tea on Tuesday,” Miss Strangeworth said gently. “A quarter pound of tea, please, Mr. Lewis.” “Is that all, Miss Strangeworth?” “Yes, thank you, Mr. Lewis. Such a lovely day, isn’t it?” “Lovely,” Mr. Lewis said.</p>

          <p>Miss Strangeworth moved slightly to make room for Mrs. Harper at the counter. “Morning, Adela,” Mrs. Harper said, and Miss Strangeworth said, “Good morning, Martha.”… “Ran out of sugar for my cake frosting,” Mrs. Harper explained. Her hand shook slightly as she opened her pocketbook. Miss Strangeworth wondered, glancing at her quickly, if she had been taking proper care of herself. Martha Harper was not as young as she used to be, Miss Strangeworth thought. She probably could use a good, strong tonic…</p>

          <p>Carrying her little bag of groceries, Miss Strangeworth came out of the store into the bright sunlight and stopped to smile down on the Crane baby. Don and Helen Crane were really the two most infatuated young parents she had ever known, she thought indulgently, looking at the delicately embroidered baby cap and the lace-edged carriage cover. “That little girl is going to grow up expecting luxury all her life,” she said to Helen Crane. Helen laughed. “That’s the way we want her to feel,” she said. “Like a princess.”</p>

          <p>“A princess can be a lot of trouble sometimes,” Miss Strangeworth said dryly. “How old is her highness now?” “Six months next Tuesday,” Helen Crane said, looking down with rapt wonder at her child. “I’ve been worrying, though, about her. Don’t you think she ought to move around more? Try to sit up, for instance?” “For plain and fancy worrying,” Miss Strangeworth said, amused, “give me a new mother every time.” “She just seems—slow,” Helen Crane said. “Nonsense. All babies are different. Some of them develop much more quickly than others.”</p>

          <p>“That’s what my mother says,” Helen Crane laughed, looking a little bit ashamed. “I suppose you’ve got young Don all upset about the fact that his daughter is already six months old and hasn’t yet begun to learn to dance?” “I haven’t mentioned it to him. I suppose she’s just so precious that I worry about her all the time.” “Well, apologize to her right now,” Miss Strangeworth said. “She is probably worrying about why you keep jumping all the time.”</p>

          <p>Smiling to herself and shaking her old head, she went on down the sunny street, stopping once to ask little Billy Moore why he wasn’t out riding in his daddy’s shiny new car, and talking for a few minutes outside the library with Miss Chandler, the librarian, about the new novels to be ordered, and paid for by the annual library appropriation. Miss Chandler seemed absent-minded and very much as though she was thinking about something else. Miss Strangeworth noticed that Miss Chandler had not taken much trouble with her hair this morning, and sighed. Miss Strangeworth hated sloppiness.</p>

          <p>Many people seemed disturbed recently, Miss Strangeworth thought. Only yesterday the Stewarts’ fifteen-year-old Linda had run crying down her own front walk and all the way to school, not caring who saw her. People around town thought she might have had a fight with the Harris boy, but they showed up together at the soda shop after school as usual, both of them looking grim and bleak.…</p>

          <p>From halfway down the block Miss Strangeworth could catch the heavy accent of her roses, and she moved a little more quickly. The perfume of roses meant home, and home meant the Strangeworth House on Pleasant Street. Miss Strangeworth stopped at her own front gate, as she always did, and looked with deep pleasure at her house, with the red and pink and white roses massed along the narrow lawn, and the rambler going up along the porch; and the neat, unbelievably trim lines of the house itself, with its slimness and its washed white look.…</p>

          <p>Miss Strangeworth went up her front steps, unlocked her front door with her key, and went into the kitchen to put away her groceries. She debated having a cup of tea and then decided it was too close to midday dinnertime; she would not have the appetite for her little chop if she had tea now. Instead, she went into the light, lovely sitting room.… Miss Strangeworth had put a bowl of her red roses on the low table before the window, and the room was full of their scent.</p>

          <p>Miss Strangeworth went to the narrow desk in the corner, and unlocked it with her key. She never knew when she might feel like writing letters, so she kept her notepaper inside, and the desk locked. Miss Strangeworth’s usual stationary was heavy and cream-coloured, with “Strangeworth House” engraved across the top, but, when she felt like writing her other letters, Miss Strangeworth used a pad of various-coloured paper, layered in pink and green and blue and yellow; everyone in town bought it and used it for odd, informal notes and shopping lists.… Everyone used the matching envelopes for tucking away recipes, or keeping odd little things in, or even to hold cookies in the school lunch boxes.…</p>

          <p>Although Miss Strangeworth’s desk held a trimmed quill pen and a gold-frosted fountain pen, Miss Strangeworth always used a dull stub of pencil when she wrote her letters, and she printed them in a childish block print. After thinking for a minute, although she had been phrasing the letter in the back of her mind all the way home, she wrote on a pink sheet: Didn’t you ever see an idiot child before? Some people just shouldn’t have children, should they?</p>

          <p>She was pleased with the letter. She was fond of doing things exactly right… After thinking for a minute, she decided that she would like to write another letter, perhaps to go to Mrs. Harper, to follow up the ones she had already mailed. She selected a green sheet this time and wrote quickly: Have you found out yet what they were all laughing about after you left the bridge club on Thursday? Or is the wife really the last one to know?</p>

          <p>Miss Strangeworth never concerned herself with facts; her letters all dealt with the more negotiable stuff of suspicion. Mr. Lewis would never have imagined for a minute that his grandson might be lifting petty cash from the store register if he had not had one of Miss Strangeworth’s letters. Miss Chandler, the librarian, and Linda Stewart’s parents would have gone unsuspectingly ahead with their lives, never aware of the possible evil lurking nearby, if Miss Strangeworth had not sent letters to open their eyes. Miss Strangeworth would have been genuinely shocked if there had been anything between Linda Stewart and the Harris boy, but, as long as evil existed unchecked in the world, it was Miss Strangeworth’s duty to keep her town alert to it. There were so many wicked people in the world and only one Strangeworth left in town. Besides, Miss Strangeworth liked writing her letters.</p>

          <p>She addressed an envelope to Don Crane after a moment’s thought, using a pink envelope to match the pink paper. Then she addressed a second envelope, green, to Mrs. Harper. Then an idea came to her and she selected a blue sheet and wrote: You never know about doctors. Remember they’re only human and need money like the rest of us. Suppose the knife slipped accidentally. Would Doctor Burns get his fee and a little extra from that nephew of yours?</p>

          <p>She addressed the blue envelope to old Mrs. Foster, who was having an operation next month. She had thought of writing one more letter, to the head of the school board, asking how a chemistry teacher like Billy Moore’s father could afford a new convertible, but all at once she was tired of writing letters. The three she had done would do for one day… She had been writing her letters—sometimes two or three a day, sometimes no more than one in a month—for the past year. She never got any answers, of course, because she never signed her name.… The town where she lived had to be kept clean and sweet, but people everywhere were lustful and evil and degraded, and needed to be watched; the world was so large, and there was only one Strangeworth left in it. Miss Strangeworth sighed, locked her desk, and put the letters into her big, black leather pocketbook, to be mailed when she took her evening walk.</p>

          <p>She broiled her little chop nicely, and had a sliced tomato and a good cup of tea ready when she sat down to her midday dinner.… Sitting in the warm sunlight that came through the tall windows of the dining room, seeing her roses massed outside, handling the heavy, old silverware and the fine, translucent china, Miss Strangeworth was pleased; she would not have cared to be doing anything else.…</p>

          <p>After a nap she worked in her garden for a little while, sparing herself because of the heat; then she went into her supper.… After her dishes were done and her kitchen set in order, she set off on her evening walk, pocketbook under her arm.… There was only one place in town where she could mail her letters, and that was the new post office, shiny with red brick and silver letters. Although Miss Strangeworth had never given the matter any particular thought, she had always made a point of mailing her letters very secretly; it would, of course, not have been wise to let anyone see her mail them. Consequently, she timed her walk so she could reach the post office just as darkness was starting to dim the outlines of the trees and the shapes of peoples’ faces, although no one could ever mistake Miss Strangeworth, with her dainty walk and her rustling skirts.</p>

          <p>There was always a group of young people around the post office.… Most of the children stood back respectfully as Miss Strangeworth passed, silenced briefly in her presence, and some of the older children greeted her, saying soberly, “Hello, Miss Strangeworth.” Miss Strangeworth smiled at them and quickly went on.… The mail slot was in the door of the post office.… Miss Strangeworth stood by the door, opening her black pocketbook to take out the letters, and heard a voice which she knew at once to be Linda Stewart’s. Poor little Linda was crying again, and Miss Strangeworth listened carefully. This was, after all, her town, and these were her people; if one of them was in trouble, she ought to know it.</p>

          <p>“I can’t tell you, Dave,” Linda was saying—so she was talking to the Harris boy, as Miss Strangeworth had supposed—“I just can’t. It’s just nasty.” “But why won’t your father let me come around anymore? What on earth did I do?” “I can’t tell you. I just wouldn’t tell you for anything. You’ve got to have a dirty, dirty mind for things like that.”… Miss Strangeworth sighed and turned away. There was so much evil in people. Even in a charming little town like this one, there was still so much evil in people.</p>

          <p>She slipped her letters into the slot, and two of them fell inside. The third caught on the edge and fell outside, onto the ground at Miss Strangeworth’s feet. She did not notice it.… Wearily Miss Strangeworth turned to go home to her quiet bed in her lovely house, and never heard the Harris boy calling to her to say that she had dropped something. “Old lady Strangeworth’s getting deaf,” he said, looking after her and holding in his hand the letter he had picked up.… “It’s for Don Crane,… this letter.… Might as well take it on over.”… He laughed. “Maybe it’s got a cheque or something in it and he’d be just as glad to have it tonight instead of tomorrow.” “Catch old lady Strangeworth sending anybody a cheque,” Linda said. “Throw it in the post office. Why do anyone a favour?”… “I’ll take it over, anyway,” the Harris boy said. “Maybe it’s good news for them. Maybe they need something happy tonight, too. Like us.” Sadly, holding hands, they wandered off down the dark street, the Harris boy carrying Miss Strangeworth’s pink envelope in his hand.</p>

          <p>Miss Strangeworth awakened the next morning with a feeling of intense happiness and, for a minute, wondered why, and then remembered that this morning three people would open her letters. Harsh, perhaps, at first, but wickedness was never easily banished, and a clean heart was a scoured heart.… Then, going downstairs, reflecting that perhaps a little waffle would be agreeable for breakfast in the sunny dining room, she found the mail on the hall floor, and bent to pick it up. A bill, the morning paper, a letter in a green envelope that looked oddly familiar. Miss Strangeworth stood perfectly still for a minute, looking down at the green envelope with the pencilled printing, and thought: It looks like one of my letters. Was one of my letters sent back? No, because no one would know where to send it. How did this get here?</p>

          <p>Miss Strangeworth was a Strangeworth of Pleasant Street. Her hand did not shake as she opened the envelope and unfolded the sheet of green paper inside. She began to cry silently for the wickedness of the world when she read the words: Look out at what used to be your roses.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">The Story of an Hour</h2>
          <p><em>By Kate Chopin</em></p>

          <p>Knowing that Mrs. Mallard was afflicted with a heart trouble, great care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband's death.</p>
          <p>It was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken sentences; veiled hints that revealed in half concealing. Her husband's friend Richards was there, too, near her. It was he who had been in the newspaper office when intelligence of the railroad disaster was received, with Brently Mallard's name leading the list of “killed.”</p>

          <p>She did not hear the story as many women have heard the same, with a paralyzed inability to accept its significance.</p>
          <p>She wept at once, with sudden, wild abandonment, in her sister's arms.</p>
          <p>When the storm of grief had spent itself she went away to her room alone.</p>
          <p>She would have no one follow her.</p>
          <p>There stood, facing the open window, a comfortable, roomy armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul.</p>

          <p>She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life.</p>
          <p>The delicious breath of rain was in the air.</p>
          <p>In the street below a peddler was crying his wares.</p>
          <p>The notes of a distant song which someone was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves.</p>
          <p>There were patches of blue sky showing here and there through the clouds that had met and piled one above the other in the west.</p>
          <p>She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quite motionless, except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her.</p>
          <p>She was young, with a fair, calm face, whose lines bespoke repression and even a certain strength.</p>
          <p>But now there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed away off yonder on one of those patches of blue sky.</p>
          <p>It was not a glance of reflection, but rather indicated a suspension of intelligent thought.</p>
          <p>There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully.</p>
          <p>What was it?</p>
          <p>She did not know; it was too subtle and elusive to name.</p>
          <p>But she felt it, creeping out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the scents, the color that filled the air.</p>
          <p>Now her bosom rose and fell tumultuously.</p>
          <p>She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her, and she was striving to beat it back with her will—</p>
          <p>but she could not.</p>
          <p>When she abandoned herself a little, a whispered word escaped her slightly parted lips.</p>
          <p>She said it over and over under her breath:</p>
          <p>“Free, free, free!”</p>

          <p>The vacant stare and the look of terror that had followed it went from her eyes.</p>
          <p>They stayed keen and bright.</p>
          <p>Her pulses beat fast, and the coursing blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body.</p>
          <p>She did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her.</p>
          <p>A clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial.</p>
          <p>She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead.</p>
          <p>But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely.</p>
          <p>And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.</p>
          <p>There would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself.</p>
          <p>There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature.</p>
          <p>And yet she had loved him—sometimes.</p>
          <p>Often she had not.</p>
          <p>What did it matter!</p>
          <p>What could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in face of this possession of self-assertion which she suddenly recognized as the strongest impulse of her being!</p>
          <p>“Free! Body and soul free!” she kept whispering.</p>

          <p>Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhole, imploring for admission.</p>
          <p>“Louise, open the door! I beg; open the door—you will make yourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven's sake open the door!”</p>
          <p>“Go away. I am not making myself ill.”</p>
          <p>No; she was drinking in a very elixir of life through that open window.</p>
          <p>Her fancy was running riot along those days ahead of her.</p>
          <p>Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of days that would be her own.</p>
          <p>She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long.</p>
          <p>It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be long.</p>
          <p>She arose at length and opened the door to her sister’s importunities.</p>
          <p>There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory.</p>
          <p>She clasped her sister’s waist, and together they descended the stairs.</p>
          <p>Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom.</p>
          <p>Someone was opening the front door with a latchkey.</p>
          <p>It was Brently Mallard who entered, a little travel-stained, composedly carrying his grip-sack and umbrella.</p>
          <p>He had been far from the scene of the accident, and did not even know there had been one.</p>
          <p>He stood amazed at Josephine’s piercing cry; at Richards’ quick motion to screen him from the view of his wife.</p>
          <p>But Richards was too late.</p>
          <p>When the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease—of joy that kills.</p>

          <p>Julia loved running through The Dark Walk, a wild laurel tunnel, where she experienced both fear and exhilaration. Each year she revisited the tunnel, enjoying the thrill and often teasing her younger brother, Stephen, who could not keep up with her. Their playful quarrels and laughter marked the beginning of their holiday adventures, filled with exploration and discovery.</p>

          <p>One day, Julia discovered a small well hidden in the walk, containing a panting trout trapped in a tiny pool of water. She and Stephen were fascinated by the trout, and while her brother enjoyed hearing imaginative stories about it, Julia was troubled by its helplessness. She thought about how the fish had endured the winter alone in the confined space and felt a mixture of concern and wonder.</p>

          <p>Determined to save the trout, Julia secretly brought water from the house and carefully rescued it from the well, carrying it to the river and releasing it safely. This courageous act brought her immense joy and satisfaction, and she reveled in the freedom she had restored to the fish.

          <p>They were new patients to me, all I had was the name, Olson. Please come down as soon as you can, my daughter is very sick.</p>
          <p>When I arrived I was met by the mother, a big startled looking woman, very clean and apologetic who merely said, Is this the doctor? and let me in. In the back, she added. You must excuse us, doctor, we have her in the kitchen where it is warm. It is very damp here sometimes.</p>

          <p>The child was fully dressed and sitting on her father's lap near the kitchen table. He tried to get up, but I motioned for him not to bother, took off my overcoat and started to look things over. I could see that they were all very nervous, eyeing me up and down distrustfully. As often, in such cases, they weren't telling me more than they had to, it was up to me to tell them; that's why they were spending three dollars on me.</p>

          <p>The child was fairly eating me up with her cold, steady eyes, and no expression to her face whatever. She did not move and seemed, inwardly, quiet; an unusually attractive little thing, and as strong as a heifer in appearance. But her face was flushed, she was breathing rapidly, and I realized that she had a high fever. She had magnificent blonde hair, in profusion. One of those picture children often reproduced in advertising leaflets and the photogravure sections of the Sunday papers.</p>

          <p>"She's had a fever for three days," began the father, "and we don't know what it comes from. My wife has given her things, you know, like people do, but it don't do no good. And there's been a lot of sickness around. So we tho't you'd better look her over and tell us what is the matter."</p>

          <p>As doctors often do I took a trial shot at it as a point of departure. "Has she had a sore throat?"</p>

          <p>Both parents answered me together, "No . . . No, she says her throat don't hurt her."</p>

          <p>"Does your throat hurt you?" added the mother to the child. But the little girl's expression didn't change nor did she move her eyes from my face.</p>

          <p>"Have you looked?"</p>

          <p>"I tried to," said the mother, "but I couldn't see."</p>

          <p>As it happens we had been having a number of cases of diphtheria in the school to which this child went during that month and we were all, quite apparently, thinking of that, though no one had as yet spoken of the thing.</p>

          <p>"Well," I said, "suppose we take a look at the throat first." I smiled in my best professional manner and asking for the child's first name I said, "Come on, Mathilda, open your mouth and let's take a look at your throat."</p>

          <p>Nothing doing.</p>

          <p>"Aw, come on," I coaxed, "just open your mouth wide and let me take a look. Look," I said opening both hands wide, "I haven't anything in my hands. Just open up and let me see."</p>

          <p>"Such a nice man," put in the mother. "Look how kind he is to you. Come on, do what he tells you. He won't hurt you."</p>

          <p>At that I ground my teeth in disgust. If only they wouldn't use the word "hurt" I might be able to get somewhere. But I did not allow myself to be hurried or disturbed but speaking quietly and slowly I approached the child again.</p>

          <p>As I moved my chair a little nearer suddenly with one catlike movement both her hands clawed instinctively for my eyes and she almost reached them too. In fact she knocked my glasses flying and they fell, though unbroken, several feet away from me on the kitchen floor.</p>

          <p>Both the mother and father almost turned themselves inside out in embarrassment and apology. "You bad girl," said the mother, taking her and shaking her by one arm. "Look what you've done. The nice man . . ."</p>

          <p>"For heaven's sake," I broke in. "Don't call me a nice man to her. I'm here to look at her throat on the chance that she might have diphtheria and possibly die of it. But that's nothing to her. Look here," I said to the child, "we're going to look at your throat. You're old enough to understand what I'm saying. Will you open it now by yourself or shall we have to open it for you?"</p>

          <p>Not a move. Even her expression hadn't changed. Her breaths however were coming faster and faster. Then the battle began. I had to do it. I had to have a throat culture for her own protection. But first I told the parents that it was entirely up to them. I explained the danger but said that I would not insist on a throat examination so long as they would take the responsibility.</p>

          <p>"If you don't do what the doctor says you'll have to go to the hospital," the mother admonished her severely.</p>

          <p>"Oh yeah?" I had to smile to myself. After all, I had already fallen in love with the savage brat, the parents were contemptible to me. In the ensuing struggle they grew more and more abject, crushed, exhausted while she surely rose to magnificent heights of insane fury of effort bred of her terror of me.</p>

          <p>The father tried his best, and he was a big man but the fact that she was his daughter, his shame at her behavior and his dread of hurting her made him release her just at the critical times when I had almost achieved success, till I wanted to kill him. But his dread also that she might have diphtheria made him tell me to go on, go on though he himself was almost fainting, while the mother moved back and forth behind us raising and lowering her hands in an agony of apprehension.</p>

          <p>"Put her in front of you on your lap," I ordered, "and hold both her wrists."</p>

          <p>But as soon as he did the child let out a scream. "Don't, you're hurting me. Let go of my hands. Let them go I tell you." Then she shrieked terrifyingly, hysterically. "Stop it! Stop it! You're killing me!"</p>

          <p>"Do you think she can stand it, doctor!" said the mother.</p>

          <p>"You get out," said the husband to his wife. "Do you want her to die of diphtheria?"</p>

          <p>"Come on now, hold her," I said.</p>

          <p>Then I grasped the child's head with my left hand and tried to get the wooden tongue depressor between her teeth. She fought, with clenched teeth, desperately! But now I also had grown furious--at a child. I tried to hold myself down but I couldn't. I know how to expose a throat for inspection. And I did my best. When finally I got the wooden spatula behind the last teeth and just the point of it into the mouth cavity, she opened up for an instant but before I could see anything she came down again and gripping the wooden blade between her molars she reduced it to splinters before I could get it out again.</p>

          <p>"Aren't you ashamed," the mother yelled at her. "Aren't you ashamed to act like that in front of the doctor?"</p>

          <p>"Get me a smooth-handled spoon of some sort," I told the mother. "We're going through with this." The child's mouth was already bleeding. Her tongue was cut and she was screaming in wild hysterical shrieks. Perhaps I should have desisted and come back in an hour or more. No doubt it would have been better. But I have seen at least two children lying dead in bed of neglect in such cases, and feeling that I must get a diagnosis now or never I went at it again. But the worst of it was that I too had got beyond reason. I could have torn the child apart in my own fury and enjoyed it. It was a pleasure to attack her. My face was burning with it.</p>

          <p>The damned little brat must be protected against her own idiocy, one says to one's self at such times. Others must be protected against her. It is a social necessity. And all these things are true. But a blind fury, a feeling of adult shame, bred of a longing for muscular release are the operatives. One goes on to the end.</p>

          <p>In a final unreasoning assault I overpowered the child's neck and jaws. I forced the heavy silver spoon back of her teeth and down her throat till she gagged. And there it was--both tonsils covered with membrane. She had fought valiantly to keep me from knowing her secret. She had been hiding that sore throat for three days at least and lying to her parents in order to escape just such an outcome as this.</p>

          <p>Now truly she was furious. She had been on the defensive before but now she attacked. Tried to get off her father's lap and fly at me while tears of defeat blinded her eyes.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Thou Art the Man</h2>
          <p><em>By Edgar Allan Poe</em></p>

          <p>A wealthy man named Augustus is found dead, and the local authorities are desperate to find the culprit. The narrator introduces a clever yet unconventional approach to solving the crime, centering around the idea of forcing the guilty party to confess by playing on human psychology and pride.</p>

          <p>The investigation focuses on identifying the murderer among a group of potential suspects, each of whom had motives and opportunities. The detective, Mr. George, devises a plan to subtly accuse each suspect in a public setting without directly pointing fingers. By doing so, he carefully observes their reactions for signs of guilt, using their pride, fear, and nervousness as tools for deduction. This method emphasizes Poe’s recurring theme of the intellect and ingenuity overcoming brute force or chance in solving crimes.</p>

          <p>Ultimately, Mr. George exposes the murderer in a dramatic and ironic twist. During a gathering, he points to the guilty man and exclaims, “Thou art the man!” The accused, caught off guard by the direct accusation and unable to hide his guilt, immediately confesses. Poe’s story is notable for its concise plot, clever psychological insights, and moral undertones, demonstrating that the mind’s sharpness can uncover truth even when traditional methods fail. The tale leaves readers with a sense of satisfaction at the detective’s ingenuity and the justice served.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Three Questions</h2>
          <p>It once occurred to a certain king, that if he always knew the right time to begin everything; if he knew who were the right people to listen to, and whom to avoid; and, above all, if he always knew what was the most important thing to do, he would never fail in anything he might undertake. And this thought having occurred to him, he had it proclaimed throughout his kingdom that he would give a great reward to any one who would teach him what was the right time for every action, and who were the most necessary people, and how he might know what was the most important thing to do.</p>

          <p>And learned men came to the King, but they all answered his questions differently. In reply to the first question, some said that to know the right time for every action, one must draw up in advance, a table of days, months and years, and must live strictly according to it. Only thus, said they, could everything be done at its proper time. Others declared that it was impossible to decide beforehand the right time for every action; but that, not letting oneself be absorbed in idle pastimes, one should always attend to all that was going on, and then do what was most needful.</p>

          <p>Others, again, said that however attentive the King might be to what was going on, it was impossible for one man to decide correctly the right time for every action, but that he should have a Council of wise men, who would help him to fix the proper time for everything. But then again others said there were some things which could not wait to be laid before a Council, but about which one had at once to decide whether to undertake them or not. But in order to decide that, one must know beforehand what was going to happen. It is only magicians who know that; and, therefore, in order to know the right time for every action, one must consult magicians.</p>

          <p>Equally various were the answers to the second question. Some said, the people the King most needed were his councillors; others, the priests; others, the doctors; while some said the warriors were the most necessary. To the third question, as to what was the most important occupation: some replied that the most important thing in the world was science. Others said it was skill in warfare; and others, again, that it was religious worship. All the answers being different, the King agreed with none of them, and gave the reward to none.</p>

          <p>But still wishing to find the right answers to his questions, he decided to consult a hermit, widely renowned for his wisdom. The hermit lived in a wood which he never quitted, and he received none but common folk. So the King put on simple clothes, and before reaching the hermit's cell dismounted from his horse, and, leaving his body-guard behind, went on alone.</p>

          <p>When the King approached, the hermit was digging the ground in front of his hut. Seeing the King, he greeted him and went on digging. The hermit was frail and weak, and each time he stuck his spade into the ground and turned a little earth, he breathed heavily. The King went up to him and said: 'I have come to you, wise hermit, to ask you to answer three questions: How can I learn to do the right thing at the right time? Who are the people I most need, and to whom should I, therefore, pay more attention than to the rest? And, what affairs are the most important, and need my first attention?'</p>

          <p>The hermit listened to the King, but answered nothing. He just spat on his hand and recommenced digging. 'You are tired,' said the King, 'let me take the spade and work awhile for you.' 'Thanks!' said the hermit, and, giving the spade to the King, he sat down on the ground. When he had dug two beds, the King stopped and repeated his questions. The hermit again gave no answer, but rose, stretched out his hand for the spade, and said: 'Now rest awhile—and let me work a bit.' But the King did not give him the spade, and continued to dig. One hour passed, and another. The sun began to sink behind the trees, and the King at last stuck the spade into the ground, and said: 'I came to you, wise man, for an answer to my questions. If you can give me none, tell me so, and I will return home.'</p>

          <p>'Here comes some one running,' said the hermit, 'let us see who it is.' The King turned round, and saw a bearded man come running out of the wood. The man held his hands pressed against his stomach, and blood was flowing from under them. When he reached the King, he fell fainting on the ground moaning feebly. The King and the hermit unfastened the man's clothing. There was a large wound in his stomach.</p>

          <p>The King washed it as best he could, and bandaged it with his handkerchief and with a towel the hermit had. But the blood would not stop flowing, and the King again and again removed the bandage soaked with warm blood, and washed and rebandaged the wound. When at last the blood ceased flowing, the man revived and asked for something to drink. The King brought fresh water and gave it to him. Meanwhile the sun had set, and it had become cool.</p>

          <p>So the King, with the hermit's help, carried the wounded man into the hut and laid him on the bed. Lying on the bed the man closed his eyes and was quiet; but the King was so tired with his walk and with the work he had done, that he crouched down on the threshold, and also fell asleep—so soundly that he slept all through the short summer night.</p>

          <p>When he awoke in the morning, it was long before he could remember where he was, or who was the strange bearded man lying on the bed and gazing intently at him with shining eyes. 'Forgive me!' said the bearded man in a weak voice, when he saw that the King was awake and was looking at him. 'I do not know you, and have nothing to forgive you for,' said the King. 'You do not know me, but I know you. I am that enemy of yours who swore to revenge himself on you, because you executed his brother and seized his property.</p>

          <p>I knew you had gone alone to see the hermit, and I resolved to kill you on your way back. But the day passed and you did not return. So I came out from my ambush to find you, and I came upon your bodyguard, and they recognized me, and wounded me. I escaped from them, but should have bled to death had you not dressed my wound. I wished to kill you, and you have saved my life. Now, if I live, and if you wish it, I will serve you as your most faithful slave, and will bid my sons do the same. Forgive me!'</p>

          <p>The King was very glad to have made peace with his enemy so easily, and to have gained him for a friend, and he not only forgave him, but said he would send his servants and his own physician to attend him, and promised to restore his property. Having taken leave of the wounded man, the King went out into the porch and looked around for the hermit. Before going away he wished once more to beg an answer to the questions he had put.</p>

          <p>The hermit was outside, on his knees, sowing seeds in the beds that had been dug the day before. The King approached him, and said: 'For the last time, I pray you to answer my questions, wise man.' 'You have already been answered!' said the hermit still crouching on his thin legs, and looking up at the King, who stood before him. 'How answered? What do you mean?' asked the King.</p>

          <p>'Do you not see,' replied the hermit. 'If you had not pitied my weakness yesterday, and had not dug those beds for me, but had gone your way, that man would have attacked you, and you would have repented of not having stayed with me. So the most important time was when you were digging the beds; and I was the most important man; and to do me good was your most important business.</p>

          <p>Afterwards when that man ran to us, the most important time was when you were attending to him, for if you had not bound up his wounds he would have died without having made peace with you. So he was the most important man, and what you did for him was your most important business. Remember then: there is only one time that is important—Now! It is the most important time because it is the only time when we have any power.</p>

          <p>The most necessary man is he with whom you are, for no man knows whether he will ever have dealings with any one else: and the most important affair is, to do him good, because for that purpose alone was man sent into this life!</p>
